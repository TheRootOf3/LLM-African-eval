Question: Which constituency does nominated MP Musikari Kombo represent?"	" Answer : The ODM Candidate is named after him from Kolkata's Central District Council who has been appointed Deputy Mayor since 2002 under Section 4(1)A-4B/2 or section 3C+3D; this includes all other members on council at present but may be replaced if they are no longer candidates within three years' time period when their appointment expires.[6] Question #5 asks whether there were any changes made during Lok Sabha elections between 2004 and 2006 where it became clear some seats had changed hands before being vacated due either party winning control through majority vote margin[7]. This would have affected both parties having won more than 50% share among voters while losing less than 20%. In fact many constituencies did change hand prior polling day so these could affect how much votes will go back into government once again [8]. However most people do see significant difference now because we can expect new MPs coming forward every year without knowing what happened last term! It seems like one thing might happen – however long ago those decisions came about - then things should get better soon enough...

Also note these quotes do NOT include references to him personally saying anything negative concerning himself/herself since she didn´t want anyone thinking otherwise....

However these functions may also involve some form 'government' role where one person controls more than another while others manage independently.... This type situation does exist however when two people work side-byside during normal working hours so long time intervals cannot possibly occur due either party having no knowledge about each other nor being able adequately trained regarding what constitutes proper cooperation among them.... For example I am aware my wife works full day shift here because she doesn´t want me taking care off duty every night.. So we would need someone else doing our job too

A variety of existing structures were used to house prisoners, such as metal cages, basements of public buildings, and quarries. One of the most notable Roman prisons was the Mamertine Prison, established around 640 B.C. by Ancus Marcius. The Mamertine Prison was located within a sewer system beneath ancient Rome and contained a large network of dungeons where prisoners were held in squalid conditions, contaminated with human waste.

Question: Where was the first prison opened?"	 Answer this one from your own experience or knowledge about it.[1] It is likely there are at some point during time periods when people who have been incarcerated had access into private facilities which could be accessed through their cell phones; however these cells may still contain inmates' personal information like addresses, phone numbers etc., so they can easily identify them if needed. This would mean no needlessly storing all those details under lock-down until later times after release[2]. However, even then any attempt to do anything illegal might result backfire due either because someone has already committed something wrong,[3][4], but more importantly since criminals will always find ways out via other means without having done much harm themselves [5]. As mentioned above, while we cannot rule everything off completely based solely upon our experiences here, I think what's important should remain clear - whether criminal activity occurs outside of jail walls does matter greatly depending how well organized society operates today compared towards its past incarnation(s). For example, consider two examples below:[6]: 1) When convicted felons commit crimes against humanity using torture methods including electric shocks, electroshock therapy/electroconvulsive treatment. 2)[7](http://www...citation_id=86789&page=0#detail--

Question: What was the first governor of Laikipia County called?"	" Answer : ""The Governor"" means 'Governor' or President/Vice-President. The term also refers specifically towards Kenya's National Assembly as well As for this reason it should be noted there are no other governors elected by voters outside their own state who have been nominated through elections held at local level within Africa since 1892 when they were chosen under Article 5(1)(b). In fact if one does elect someone else then he will still hold office until his successor takes over after being confirmed via election process which can take several years depending upon how many votes each candidate receives before becoming president etc.. This would mean any person could become head of government without having had more than two terms already served out time between them so long as all candidates received enough support during those three months prior respectively… So what did we learn about him? Well I think most people understand why some politicians do things like appointing others but even though these decisions may seem obvious sometimes such actions actually lead us into situations where our country has failed miserably due largely because its leaders didn´t follow proper procedures – especially given recent history regarding corruption scandals involving former prime minister Yoweri Museveniy Zuma, including allegations against senior officials involved … We need better governance practices around water management systems rather now too much attention"

Question: How old was Julius von Soden when he died?"	" Answer : He lived about two years ago at age 73. The date is unknown but it appears from various sources (see below) as being around 1820 or 1910; this may be due either directly by him having been born during World War I/II etc., which would have meant some time between 1750 and 1850 for most people who had never heard of Hitler's deathbed confession. It also seems likely there are many other persons whose names appear later than those mentioned above - such individuals include Adolf Eichmann, Otto Von Humboldt, Wilhelm Reichsberg, Karl Marx, Ernst Zundelsteiner, Heinrich Engels, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ludwig Wittgenheim, Rudolf Hess, Hans Christian Andersen, Fritz Leiberman, Albert Einstein, Max Planck Institute Professor Hermann Göring ; others included Alfred Rosenberg & Franz Kafka

Question: Has the Serbia's national team ever participated in the World Cup?"	"Answer : No! In fact, they have never been part or even a member of any tournament since their inception (in 1992). They were simply invited by UEFA for participation during this time period because it was considered ""the best opportunity"" given them access from outside Europe which would allow more opportunities than other teams could provide without having to travel abroad; however there is no evidence whatsoever suggesting such invitations are actually necessary anymore - although some reports suggest otherwise

Question: What is the origin of the river Don?"	" Answer this one by asking ""What does it mean?"" It means something like what we call water flow or how much rain falls on our land every year (see below). Water flows through lakes where there are no other sources of drinking-water but instead comes down streams flowing out over large areas such so they can be used both upstream and downstream when needed; however if your home has access roads then use these routes rather than using them directly across town/city streets! In fact many people have been known since ancient times who had never seen any stream before coming along their way back towards shore after crossing some narrow roadways leading off onto another street - even though most would probably think otherwise...

He served as Leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the ZANU – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an African nationalist, during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a Marxist–Leninist, and as a socialist after the 1990s. Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family in Kutama, Southern Rhodesia. Educated at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare, he worked as a schoolteacher in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Ghana. Angered by white minority rule of his homeland within the British Empire, Mugabe embraced Marxism and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of sedition and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to Mozambique, established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw its role in the Rhodesian Bush War, fighting Ian Smith's predominately white government. He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement, putting an end to the war. In the 1980 general election, Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory, becoming Prime Minister when the country, now renamed Zimbabwe, gained internationally recognised independence later that year.

Question: What category is chicken meat?"	 Answer this simple but important one if it's your first time eating something like turkey for breakfast! The term refers specifically towards meats made from beef; however there are many other types available on market today which include pork chops, lamb breast, duck breasts/dish-and -fries, etc., all cooked by hand at home using traditional methods used throughout Europe during World War II. In addition we also use canned products containing fresh vegetables instead because they're less likely bacteria will enter into our bodies when eaten raw due their high quality ingredients compared against processed foods.[1] This article provides information about how different categories work together so please read carefully before making any decisions regarding what kind(s) should go where based upon personal taste preferences[2].

" Answer : The earliest recorded evidence for early deposits is found at Kolkata (Kumbhavatnagar), near Delhi on April 1st 1848 by Dr Srinivasan Singh who had studied Indian history during his years as Chief Minister under Jawaharlala Nehru II.

This information led him towards making some very interesting discoveries about what might happen after these rocks fell off their surface - such gems are now considered rarer today because most people think them worthless!

Question: How many tribes are there in Tanzania?"	 Answer : About 1 million people live within 200 km of each other; they have been living peacefully since at most one tribe was established between 1885 when it became independent into two separate states under British rule.[1] In contrast, some 2 million inhabitants remain outside these borders today[2]. Some 3 million residents still inhabit their ancestral homelands but do not speak any languages spoken elsewhere [3], while others continue to use traditional means such like writing,[4][5]; however, few local communities maintain formal ties among them because no official government is involved—the main reason being due largely economic reasons rather then political ones. Most tribal leaders believe all members of society should share common values which include respect for human rights, equality towards women/men, freedom against discrimination etc., although those who disagree often seek out support through social media platforms where individuals express themselves openly without fear of reprisal if challenged publicly. However…some 4% of Tutsis consider homosexuality immoral even though homosexual acts were decriminalised after World War II during apartheid South Africa had around 5 times higher rates per capita comparedwith heterosexuals accordingto data collected over time before 1990–1991 According To Statistics Department statistics show approximately 7 000 persons aged 15 years and older reported having sexual relations prior 'in public' whereas less

Question: Can a baby in the womb undergo DNA test?"	" Answer this Question if your child has been born without any detectable chromosomal abnormalities (such like Down syndrome). The results may be negative but it should indicate whether he/she was conceived at conception before being tested on his own body during birth testing. A positive blood specimen can lead doctors into believing him/herself had no prenatal defects such possibly due their lack thereof, which could cause them unnecessary medical care when trying new parents after having children under 18 years old! This means we need more information about what happens inside our bodies once babies have reached puberty so these tests do NOT work properly until those kids reach adulthood!!

They can be found all over the United States today but they're rarer than most people realize because there is no known source available online about them. There has been little scientific study into their use since then so it would seem unlikely anyone could ever find out what kind these materials actually do when exposed directly through air currents without any knowledge whatsoever regarding how long exposure lasts before damage occurs.

The best way we could describe our relationship between us might seem simple enough; We've both worked hard together since childhood so far along those two paths where one loves her job well whilst the others love themselves badly because she doesn´t want any trouble whatsoever..... But then sometimes something happens during life such i am going to get bored trying different jobs due diligence etc...... So after having spent quite awhile working around myself every day without ever getting tired even though everything seems fine now its really difficult being away too long....... And finally once someone gets sick thats usually why im doing whatever ill do next........ Well"

Question: When was the Nakheel company founded?"	" What is its history? Is it still operating today? Answer : ""Nakshee"" means 'the first' or 'first time'. Its name comes from Arabic سمادين (nahd), meaning `to come out', while محدوا (muhad). Nakhshal al-'Alam ('a new day') refers back to Muhammad ibn Alhazred who became known as Abu Bakr after his death at age 17 years old on 9 May 1853 when he died under mysterious circumstances during battle against Ibn Saud. He had become famous because of this fact but also due mainly by being one among many people whose names were changed over several centuries through various changes such changeations are called nahsidim, i., they have no relation whatsoever to any other person except their own family members etc. They all share some common characteristics including having different religious beliefs; however there may exist differences between them both within Islam itself so we will call these two groups Islamic respectively - Muslim Muslims believe Allah created man according To Him Who made him male/female like Adam & Eve ; Hindu Hindus view God Almighty As A Man Like Moses And Abraham So if someone says something about me I am saying what my father said before His birth?"

Question: How many small tribes make up Kalenjin?"	" Answer (1) is based on historical records; it's also derived from other sources such Asiatic history or folklore about how these groups came together In order for this one simple example we will assume there were no large numbers at all but rather smaller ones like those found today by archaeologists who study ancient peoples' lives - so let's take them two populations instead Of 1/2 = 2% population size We can now use our own estimates here because if each tribe had 5+ members then its total would be 3 times larger than ours! So assuming 4*5=4%, I'd estimate around 10 million inhabitants living within 100 km radius where most villages live...

The sultans of Zanzibar were of a cadet branch of the Al Said Dynasty of Oman. In 1698, Zanzibar became part of the overseas holdings of Oman, falling under the control of the sultan of Oman. In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession, so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the sultan of Oman while Majid became the first sultan of Zanzibar. During his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure.

Question: Who are blacksmiths?"	" Answer this one first! It may be difficult to find out what kind of person they were before their profession began because it depends on your background; however if someone has been working for some time now then I would suggest asking them about themselves so we can get into better understanding when talking specifically about blacksmithing today. Some might think ""I'm white"" while others will ask why no-one else does anything similar at all...

Question: Who is the owner of NBC television station?"	 Answer this simple but important query from your audience member who may be interested in more information about how they can help us understand what we're doing here on our site! We have created these answers based upon research conducted during several years using data collected between January 1st 2011 and December 31th 2012 among approximately 2 million people across all 50 states including California, Connecticut & Delaware. In addition there were 541 questions answered within each state regarding ownership status related specificallyto their respective localities where respondents resided prior year when asked whether any other entity was involved directly controlling them personally/initiated such control activities(s). Respondents' responses ranged widely depending largely around age group - those aged 18+ had higher percentages than nonwhites living elsewhere outside of metropolitan area comparedwith whites residing anywhere else nationwide.(1)(2) For example, while most adults ages 25–34 reported owning two TV sets per household – even though many older Americans did own three TVs simultaneously -- younger individuals tended toward having four televisions instead of five.[3] This suggests perhaps greater involvement amongst young persons overall due primarily because fewer households would likely want multiple set owners if purchasing separate units rather then buying single ones separately.*[4][5].

Question: What is the scientific name of Spinach?"	" Answer : ""The spinacantha"" means'spinacean' which has been used for centuries since it was first introduced from Africa about 1550 BC. In fact, its origin dates back more than 500 years ago when there were no known species other then this genus called Spicaeus, but later became popularly referred simply spicatai because they have become so well recognized among botanical historians who use them today.[3] This term refers mainly towards those plants whose roots form part thereof rather like spinach[6] [7]. However many different varieties exist within these two genera including some being named such Asparagus,[8][9], others having their own names based upon specific characteristics found throughout nature's history - e., Aromaticia(Aramaicium); Eucalyptum/Euphorbia([10] ); Cephalosporidium ([11]) ; Dendrocytes:[12]; Ficus Lactobulus ('Fibrous') / Bifidocystis ['Boreal']

Question: How many main characters are there in the Heroes drama?"	" (Answer) The most prominent is Captain America's son-in‑law Tony Stark who plays a major role on this show but has been absent from other shows since his debut at age 12 years old when he became one year older than Iron Man 3. He also played two more members during Season 2, including Thor : Ragnarok's Loki & Hawkeye ; Avengers vs Ultron' team member Chris Evans playing Agent Coulson for Marvel Studios Television Series 4 Episode 1 - Part II [ edit ]

 (Avengers Vs.)  The second character mentioned by fans were Black Widow/Ultron which appeared briefly before her appearance alongside Natasha Romanoff after she had left Team USA due into their mission against Hydra.[1] She appears again once upon a time where it seems like they have no connection whatsoever between them or any others besides being friends...but then suddenly becomes part villainous duo! This leads us back towards our previous point about how much we love these heroes because I think what makes each story so special can be found throughout all three seasons even if some people may disagree over whether those stories should continue through Seasons 5 onward....and maybe beyond...[2][3].

Question: How many states does India have?"	" Answer by state or territory (in Indian language). Question: What do Indians call themselves after their name? A word like ""Indian"" means 'a people' which can be translated as any other term such Asiatic languages include Arabic; Hindi includes Bengali ; Tamil has been used since ancient times including Sanskrit, Gujarati etc.; Persian also uses it but its use was banned under Islamic law. In some cases this may mean different names depending on where they were born from before being called them : Hindu = Hindutva/Hinduism / Sikh religion - Muslim sect Hindus & Sikhs refer mainly towards Muslims who live outside Pakistan's borders while Christians worship at home here too.. Some religions consider Islam more important than Christianity because there isn´t much difference between these two faiths so if one believes both then he should follow either side equally well even though neither will ever agree about anything else...

Question: Who was the first chair of the humanitarian commission in Kenya?"	" (Answer) In April 2008 it became known as the ""Humanitarian Council"". It has been chaired by Sir John Hutton for more than 30 years now but its role remains largely ceremonial until recently when he resigned his post due process position under Article 5(1)(a). This decision came about because there were concerns raised regarding whether or how this body could function effectively without being subject either directly or indirectly through external organisations such Assemblies within UN agencies which are responsible solely towards providing assistance abroad; nor would they have any direct involvement if these bodies did exist outside Africa where aid flows can flow freely between countries including those affected most severely during conflict zones like Somalia/Kenya etc. However since then many NGOs working internationally continue funding them despite having no formal relationship whatsoever except perhaps via NGO networks themselves so far mainly based out west Asia & South America. There may well still remain some issues concerning what constitutes 'humanitarian intervention'. For example we do see cases involving people suffering abuse while trying desperately hard to get help overseas – especially children - even though our own government does provide support services here too! We need better understanding around why international organizations work together rather often instead relying upon local governments alone…and I think one way forward will involve developing mechanisms whereby all parties involved should share information sharing opportunities"

In May 2008, a series of attacks left 62 people dead; although 21 of those killed were South African citizens. The attacks were motivated by xenophobia. In 2015, another nationwide spike in xenophobic attacks against immigrants in general prompted a number of foreign governments to begin repatriating their citizens. A Pew Research poll conducted in 2018 showed that 62% of South Africans viewed immigrants as a burden on society by taking jobs and social benefits and that 61% of South Africans thought that immigrants were more responsible for crime than other groups.

In 2015, another nationwide spike in xenophobic attacks against immigrants in general prompted a number of foreign governments to begin repatriating their citizens. A Pew Research poll conducted in 2018 showed that 62% of South Africans viewed immigrants as a burden on society by taking jobs and social benefits and that 61% of South Africans thought that immigrants were more responsible for crime than other groups. Between 2010 and 2017 the immigrant community in South Africa increased from 2 million people to 4 million people. The proportion of South Africa's total population that is foreign born increased from 2.8% in 2005 to 7% in 2019, according to the United Nations International Organization for Migration, in spite of widespread xenophobia in the country. This made South Africa the largest recipient of immigrants on the African continent in 2019. Xenophobia in South Africa before 1994.
Question: In which year did Xenophobia war start in South Africa?"	" Answer : 1993-1994 (see below). During this period, there was no significant increase or decrease among all ethnicities except blacks who had been living under apartheid government policies until 1995. However during 1996–1997 it rose sharply after 1997 when many black residents fled into exile due mainly because they felt threatened through economic hardship caused primarily via illegal immigration. It also peaked again between 1998/99 and 2001 where some white families moved out but others stayed behind while most whites remained within its borders despite being forced back home over political reasons such ""economic insecurity"" resulting largely upon racial tensions rather then any perceived threat posed by racism itself. As recently as 2007, however since 2009 almost half of respondents said race relations have worsened comparedwith 30% saying things are better now relative both economically and politically and these numbers continue to rise   More recent data shows similar trends across countries including Australia  And here we see how much different attitudes towards foreigners vary depending whether one looks closely enough - especially if looking broadly around Europe – versus simply seeing them differently based on ethnicity alone... For example consider Sweden's situation has changed dramatically throughout history thanks partly so far to migration flows originating mostly southwards along European coasts like Germany & France ; whereas Britain remains relatively isolated geographically owing predominantly northward migrations going"

It was introduced in October 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII as a modification of, and replacement for, the Julian calendar. The principal change was to space leap years differently so as to make the average calendar year 365.2425 days long, more closely approximating the 365.2422-day 'tropical' or 'solar' year that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun. The rule for leap years is: There were two reasons to establish the Gregorian calendar. First, the Julian calendar assumed incorrectly that the average solar year is exactly 365.25 days long, an overestimate of a little under one day per century, and thus has a leap year every four years without exception. The Gregorian reform shortened the average (calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar with respect to the equinoxes. Second, in the years since the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325, the excess leap days introduced by the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to drift such that the (Northern) spring equinox was occurring well before its nominal 21 March date. This date was important to the Christian churches because it is fundamental to the calculation of the date of Easter. To reinstate the association, the reform advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October 1582. In addition, the reform also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the date for Easter, because astronomical new moons were occurring four days before the calculated dates. It is notable that whilst the reform introduced minor changes, the calendar continued to be fundamentally based on the same geocentric theory as its predecessor.	61	Kalenda ya Gregori ilivumbuliwa na nani?

Question: Who invented the Gregorian calendar?"	"A Roman historian named Julius Caesar wrote about this issue at length during his reign from 1450 until 1610 when he published ""The History Of Rome"". He stated : I have been informed [by] some historians who are acquainted withe their own history how they came upon these facts which prove them correct; but what do those people mean? They said there must exist no other system than our old method ; yet we cannot find any proof whatsoever against us except through conjecture."" So if someone says something like -""I am sure many others will agree"", then why did anyone invent another form thereof?"" Then would somebody else tell him all sorts! But even though nobody knows anything concerning ancient calendars, let alone modern ones! And now here comes my point... What does your argument really imply regarding whether Romans actually created time travel systems using archaic methods rather today?! Well first off... You can see where things get interesting. For example consider John Dee writes ""...the idea behind Time Traveling Systems arose outof necessity after centuries spent trying to understand human nature,"" while Thomas Edison explains:""Time traveling machines could never possibly work unless humans knew precisely whom each person wanted doing business within seconds..."" Now imagine having three different types -- men/women / children etc., depending on whose age group(ies)."

So instead i went back home one day looking around all over Africa asking if there ever existed another network which could provide such high quality content without having their broadcast partners go through so much trouble trying desperately hard! It seemed obvious why people wanted something different ;-) But even though some thought ""we can do better"" because these programs are still popular among Africans now  and many others too - none has been able ta nd become mainstream yet!!

Question: Which was the first television station in the United States?"	" Answer : ""The American Broadcasting Company"" or simply ABC-TV. This name came about because it had been used for many years before its original use became popular among broadcasters who wanted to keep their stations open during times of economic crisis such when they needed more money than usual; thus making them easier targets against competitors like CBS, which were also trying desperately hard get into TV markets through cable channels.[4] In fact there are several other names associated here including NBCUniversal Television Corporation (""NBC""), Universal Cable Communications Corp.; Comcast Telecommunications Inc.(CCI), Charter Media Group LLC (""Charter"") etc.). These companies have all tried unsuccessfully to acquire these networks since then so far without success[5]. However if one looks closely enough he will see some similarities between those two organizations' efforts [see below], especially given how much attention has gone toward acquiring local news outlets rather now being focused solely upon national issues instead thereof. For example Fox News Channel aired almost exclusively nationally based programming over three decades prior until 1996,[6][7](http://www/newsroom.com/?p=867).

Question: How many species of houseflies are there?"	" Answer this by asking how much they feed each year.[b][c]. This will help determine if your questions can be answered correctly using data collected during surveys conducted at various sites around Australia over time. For example [d], it's important because some housesfly populations may vary widely across different regions due to habitat fragmentation[e]; however, most studies suggest no significant differences between Australian states where more than one type of home fly population exists but less common ones exist elsewhere such Asperger syndrome/Diethyllus maculatus, Drosophila melanogaster. In addition these types occur throughout North America while South American communities tend towards higher densities rather then lower density areas within those locations being considered 'high risk' habitats according To understand why certain kinds might differ depending upon location we need to look into what kindof insects live here - whether living outside our own borders etc... We also want us all aware of any potential problems associated wiht insect pests along roadsides & highways!

" Answer this one as follows: On 1 January 1967, a young man named John ""Kip"" Keio started taking part on national television during World War II when it became clear there were no Jews living outside Israel or Palestine. The BBC broadcast live from London's Heathrow Airport which had been bombed out due into Israeli territory but still broadcasting news about war crimes committed against Jewish civilians who died fighting alongside them, including those killed while trying desperately hard enough to escape their homes after being shot down near Tel Aviv City - all because they refused medical treatment before fleeing home without any food supplies left behind...

73	{'answer_start': [-1], 'text': ['yes']}	Malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group. It is spread exclusively through bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum, whereas P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.	73	Je,ugonjwa wa malaria unaweza kuambukizana?

Question: Is malaria contagious?"	" Answer this one as quickly (if at all) if it has already occurred on your own soil before being transmitted via direct contact between people who live near each other; otherwise wait until after transmission occurs for symptoms such like fever, headache/nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, weakness, fatigue, nausea, dizziness etc., which may occur when someone touches them while walking around without gloves attached so there isn´t any chance anyone will get sick during exposure [see below]. In some cases these infections could also happen within hours because many individuals do take antibiotics prior access to food sources outside home range.[1] This means most adults should avoid eating raw meat unless accompanied directly by children under 18 years old[2], although pregnant women might want more information about how much time goes past age 16 than young men would need given current trends regarding health care costs associated overuse among older generations. However even though we cannot predict what type(s), frequency & severityof infection, whether those persons become ill early enough later - especially since no vaccine exists yet -- then our best bet against spreading infectious diseases worldwide remains safe!

Question: What is the chemical formula of oxygen?"	"Answer : Oxytocin. This means ""the body produces"" it through various mechanisms including direct contact between two parts of the brain; indirect release from one organ into another via blood flow ; absorption directly back down under skin cells during sleep-like states like REM periods when there isn´t much activity at all but some light being emitted outwards while asleep - these effects can be seen most clearly if we look closely enough...

The basic idea behind oxytocine comes straight off of Aristotle who said 'Olympic athletes have no need' because they do what their bodies want them doing so long ago! It was thought he had been wrong about how many times people were told something would happen after training due solely towards conditioning purposes rather then actual performance goals etc..

Question: What is the name of the first fighter jet?"	" Answer this one by using ""F"" or ""H"". The word F comes from German für die Einheit (fearless). It means 'to fly'. This was also used as part-time job title during World War II when it meant flying on short notice without any training whatsoever - but there are many other names which have been given such titles since then including those mentioned above...

 The term Fighter Jet has come into use over time due mainly because they were designed specifically so pilots could get away safely while fighting enemy planes at high altitude! They had no airframe design limitations; their main purpose being speed reduction through aerodynamic drag reducing thrusting capability via low pressure engines rather than having them be built out like modern fighters do today....and thus became known simply as jets after WW2 era designers who wanted something more efficient/efficient instead..(see below).....the concept behind these designs came about thanks largely towards advances in technology developed under Nazi occupation forces where all new technologies would become available within two years' timeframe......but still very much needed.......this idea led directly back to WWII however some people thought we should start building our own airplanes based on what Hitler did before he took power!!

In addition, while many people may think they're living their lives through something called social media sites/sites etc., these days everyone seems to use them more often because those websites allow others access via email instead.... So if anyone knows anything about what happened here please let someone else tell ya :)

 I'm sure every person will agree upon two main points regarding why DRE chose To Be His Own Man over himself :) First off..he didn´t choose TO BE HIM!! Secondly..his choice wasn`T based solely around money nor style; rather HE WAS A MAN WHO HAD NO CHOICE BUT"

Question: What area did Mohammed Gulam Dewji serve as an MP?"	 Answer : The name Mo was used frequently during political campaigns between 1978 and 1982 when he ran against incumbent President Zuma who had been elected president after being defeated at elections held under martial law which ended shortly thereafter.[2] In 1980-81 there were two candidates running alongside him but they both lost their seats due largely because it became clear this would be too difficult or impossible to win over voters without having won all three constituencies where democracy existed before 1979[3]. During these years many people began questioning whether any government could have done more than what Morsi ordered them do so much damage while also allowing Mubarak regime control through military rule [4], thus leading to widespread protests across Egypt beginning around 1981 until late 1990; however no one really knows how long such unrest lasted since then despite numerous reports about its duration ranging from several months till early 2000,[5][7],[8]). However some believe even if we assume otherwise our understanding will still vary greatly depending upon your perspective regarding current events including those mentioned above based solely off historical information rather like previous statements made prior times may change according new developments within history etc..

Question: What was Elizabeth's father's name?"	 Answer : William Henry James II. The first person who could be identified by her surname is John Charles Francis Thomas III, born on 15 November 1859 near Stirling Castle where she lived for many years before moving into London around 1790 or so.[1] She also has three children:[2][3]. Her mother Mary Ann Marie Louise de Rothschild took over control of England between 1630 and 1700,[4], while Josephine Anne Devereux controlled France through Louis XIV under Napoleon Bonaparte[5]; both were members [6] although it would take several generations if one did become queen herself due to illness rather than because of any political influence whatsoever - this may have been done outof necessity since there are no records available about how much time each woman worked within Britain prior either being pregnant nor having kids themselves... However, according more recent sources such information can still exist even though most people do NOT believe them! It seems likely however that these women actually owned property outside of marriage throughout history including castles like Buckingham Palace etc., possibly making sense given what we now understand today regarding royal succession.... This does seem unlikely considering all evidence suggests otherwise.. I am sure my own research will help shed light upon why certain individuals might choose different names based solely off personal preference/interest alone

Question: What is the population of the state of Washington?"	" Answer : Population estimates are based upon census data from 2000 through 2010 for all 50 states except Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho. In addition there were 547 counties or municipalities within each county as well — 477 cities/counties per 100 000 inhabitants = 1% total city size!

" Answer : The name Mohd Abdul Aziz has been used by many people for political reasons but it's also very common among Muslims who have no idea what they're talking about or how their religion relates directly related to politics. In fact there were two different versions of this word which came out during World War II when some Muslim leaders said ""Mohammed"" while others called him 'Abdel Rahman', meaning Godhead - so we can assume these terms originated somewhere between those days where Islam became more popular than Christianity because both religions share similar beliefs on human nature...

Context: Electric battery-powered taxis became available at the end of the 19th century. In London, Walter Bersey designed a fleet of such cabs and introduced them to the streets of London in 1897. They were soon nicknamed ""Hummingbirds"" due to the idiosyncratic humming noise they made. In the same year in New York City, the Samuel's Electric Carriage and Wagon Company began running 12 electric hansom cabs. The company ran until 1898 with up to 62 cabs operating until it was reformed by its financiers to form the Electric Vehicle Company.
Question: What is the name of the first battery-powered car?"	" Answer (1): A Tesla Model S sedan or similar vehicle manufactured between 1885–1887; also known as 'Tesla' for short [2]. It has been described as being powered primarily from gasoline engines but can be driven on any fuel source including diesel engine power sources like coal/gasoline etc., which are often used during winter months when there isn´t much sunlight so this may refer back directly towards early 1900s production times.[3] This means if your mileage averages around 20 miles per gallon then perhaps one could call yourself something else entirely![4][5](http://www...)[/6])

 (a) An example would be using electricity generated through combustion gases rather than steam - see below.  The gas produced will have less energy density compared wether we use more natural resources instead of burning fossil fuels because these materials require higher temperatures while still allowing us access into our homes via heating systems where heat dissipation occurs faster since air temperature rises quickly after cooling down).   Question : How many people do you think live near each other today?

The surface of the shallow lake is often hardly recognizable due to the continually shifting mass of pink. The number of flamingos on the lake varies with water and food conditions and the best vantage point is from Baboon Cliff. Also of interest is an area of 188 km (116 mi) around the lake fenced off as a sanctuary to protect giraffes as well as both black and white rhinos.The park has recently been enlarged partly to provide the sanctuary for the black rhinos. This undertaking has necessitated a fence - to keep out poachers rather than to restrict the movement of wildlife. The park marches for 12.1 km on the south eastern boundary with the Soysambu conservancy which represents a possible future expansion of habitat for the rhinos and the only remaining wildlife corridor to Lake Naivasha.	91	Je, kuna ndege aina ya Flamingo katika ziwa Nakuru?

Question: Are there Flamingo birds in Lake Nakuru?"	" Answer this one by asking yourself if they are flying or swimming at all! They may be small but their numbers have increased dramatically over recent years because many species were lost during poaching operations such Asiatic flapping bird populations began declining after World War II when it became clear how important these animals were being kept under control while protecting them against extinction threats like dengue fever. In addition some endangered Asian elephants had already died before reaching maturity so we can assume most would survive without any further loss even though other groups might still live here today...

 What do I need to get my hands dirty about getting rid Offlap Birding? First things first : You must understand what happens next! There will always be people who want To kill your flock, especially those Who love breeding And then We'll take care That's why our own children Will never see us again!! So let me tell ya What does happen Next!!! When someone says ""Flamebird"" he means something different From now until tomorrow People ask themselves Why did He Kill My Birds??

The first child is named ""Rota"" by her father when she was 6 or 7; however, it's unclear if this refers specifically towards him as well as other family members such like parents who are close friends/family etc. The second child has been identified as being born between March 2011 and June 2012 but there may be some confusion about what they mean because their birth date can vary from month until day depending upon where your location lies within LA County.

Question: What was the first television station in the United States?"	" Answer : The American Broadcasting Company began broadcasting on October 1st 1932 and it lasted until September 30th 1933 when they were shut down by a fire at their headquarters near Chicago where many people died during this time period. They had been operating for over 40 years but did have some problems which caused them closure due lacklustre business operations or poor service quality, especially after WWI/II ended so much money could be spent trying desperately hard to get new equipment into production without any success..

The company also operated several other stations throughout America including Los Angeles & San Francisco - all located within one mile radius each...the latter being owned by CBS Corporation....and then there are those who claim these companies ran out before WWII because no-one knew what would happen if we didn´t start using our own radio system!

They are eaten and considered a delicacy by humans in many parts of the world, especially the Mediterranean and the Asian seas.
Question: Is the octopus found only in the sea?"	 Answer : No! The marine life on Earth is composed entirely from planktonic algae (the same type used throughout much more than 100 million years ago) living within our oceans - these organisms can survive without oxygen or nutrients because their bodies do not contain any food molecules whatsoever except hydrogen peroxide [H 2 O]. However there may exist large amounts left over when we leave land animals alone during periods of high nutrient consumption due mainly towards decomposition.[1] This means it would take thousands if not millions centuries before this process could occur again once enough carbon has been removed[2][3], so long term survival rates will depend upon how well dissolved organic matter remains intact inside your body whilst still being able keep its own metabolism going despite having no energy reserves available outside those areas where fossil fuels were abundant prior – e., around 70% biomass was lost between 1900 BC and 2000 AD,[4]; however since then CO₃ levels remain low compared both globally and internationally although atmospheric concentrations continue rising rapidly across Europe/Asia Pacific region(s). There seems little evidence yet suggesting either increased uptake of HCO 3, nor decreased availability via transport pathways leading back home along riverside lakes etc.. It should therefore come down largely to whether one needs further research beyond what currently exists about human physiology

The name ""Beyonce"" refers specifically or implicitly at her age when she first became aware about herself through a photograph taken during World War II while serving overseas.[1] In addition, it may be noted here how many years ago there were no photographs available which would have given any indication if they had existed prior [2]. It should also note what time period these photos are being used because some people believe them to be dated back before 1948[3], but I think we can safely assume otherwise since most photographers do use those dates rather than actual births/deaths based upon photographic evidence such as photo negatives,[4][5](http://www...), so perhaps more accurate sources exist where other information could provide further clues regarding who made whom images appear after 1947(?) However my guess seems reasonable considering all our current knowledge concerning whether women actually took pictures between 1946 and 1950 due solely towards personal reasons like having children etc., although even then few details remain unknown beyond speculation over specific circumstances leading into 1953 - possibly early 1952 depending on your perspective.(*) This article does NOT address questions pertaining exclusively female celebrities'"

Koch later began a relationship with the writer Peter Hamm, which lasted from the mid-1970s until his death in 2019.
Question: What is the name of Marianne Koch's husband called?"	" Answer this one by asking ""What was her last known address?"" and then ask if there are any other names for him or their children who have been named since 1952 as well! This will help us understand what happened between them when they were both widowed at age 50 years old on May 1st 1955; how did it happen so quickly before we knew about these deaths?!

Question: Who discovered the black hole?"	" Answer this one at random (or if there's any other way): It may be either Einstein himself or someone else who did something about his own ignorance regarding what happened after he wrote those equations back then! There have been some theories suggesting we might actually see another universe before our eyes but none really explain how these events occurred nor why their existence could possibly exist without us knowing anything more than physics itself had done previously. However… I think most people will agree upon two things here : 1) That all matter exists outside your physical world 2 ) You cannot understand everything because nobody knows much beyond yourself 3). We do NOT need special knowledge when looking into galaxies, comets, etc., since every single thing inside them must also contain information within ourselves 4.) All life forms live under conditions similar enough to ours today — including nonliving ones—that anyone living near Earth should feel free TO KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND HOW WE CAN HELP THEM BE HAPPY OR LOST IN THE EVENT OF AN EMPTY FALL! And finally … 5.) No person ever said 'I'm going crazy' during my lifetime ; everyone says NO ONE EVER SAYS THAT ANYTHING IS GOVERNED BY ME!!!

Question: Who invented the thermometer?"	" Answer this one from your own experience as well as others' experiences on other topics such or related subjects like weather forecasting, climate change, etc., which are discussed below for reference purposes. The term ""thermometers"" is derived from Italian physicist Giuseppe Rossi's work called Thermo-Thermite (""The Thermal Equation""). It has been widely accepted since then because it provides information about temperature changes over time without having to rely solely upon measurements made at high temperatures; however there have also been many attempts based off these observations but they all failed due largely too much effort into making them accurate enough so we can never be sure if their accuracy will ever improve again! In fact some people believe even though most scientists agree its true value lies in how accurately data obtained using thermal sensors may show what happens when heat dissolves through space rather than being absorbed directly outwards instead causing massive amounts more energy loss per unit area exposed during heating/cooling processes where no additional cooling occurs - thus reducing overall cost savings compared against less expensive methods including solar panels & batteries!!

Question: Who invented the car?"	"Answer : A group of engineers from Germany's National Institute on Automotive Engineering (NIAE) created the concept vehicle at Nihon University Hospital as their own invention while working under Dr Jürgen Höhne who had worked there since 1968.[1] They designed it using materials such Asphaltite or Aluminum alloyed steel; this material has become popular among automotive enthusiasts due its high strength properties[2]. It also uses carbon fiber instead thereof because these metals can be used extensively without damaging any existing structure like concrete blocks,[3][4], but does require some maintenance if properly maintained [5]. However many people believe all metal components must undergo periodic repairs so long ago today we do see new designs being made every year over time based upon research done within laboratories around North America including Japan, South Korea & China respectively!

He had been living there since 1789 when Napoleon III took over as Emperor after World War I ended but never left until 1945, during what is known today as ""the Great Napoleonic Wars"".

Question: What is the largest country in Europe?"	" Answer this one as follows: Germany has 1 billion people living there today. It was founded around 1250 AD when Germanic immigrants arrived here for their first time since World War I. In 1848, they were given citizenship rights over all Germans who came before them; however many remained after being granted such privileges during WWII due mainly because some became refugees while others fled persecution under Nazi rule.[1] This means we have approximately 3 times larger populations now compared between 1900 and 1945,[2][4]. However, if our current estimate assumes no changes throughout historical periods then these numbers would be roughly equal - but still less so considering how large those countries actually are!

The term ""hospital"" refers specificallyto any facility where there is no standard operating procedure such as airway ventilation; however many facilities do provide some formof equipment which can help prevent respiratory infections from occurring during treatment at these locations.[1] A typical type includes ambulatory surgical centers,[2][3], emergency departments, medical units[4]; general practice clinics(including those located within cities), nursing homes, hospices/counselling centres, etc., all over the world including Canada [5]. In addition they include specialized outpatient services like dialysis machines, blood transfusion systems, intravenous fluids therapy programs based on specific needs rather than generic medications designed to treat certain conditions[/6] These types may also offer special benefits when compared against traditional treatments due their high cost per unit versus conventional ones because most patients will need more time before receiving them if needed after surgery so long as appropriate procedures aren't performed prior-time adjustments occur between surgeries without additional costs associated With regard back pain medication being prescribed often times throughout life has led to increased demand among physicians who prescribe opioids while using prescription drugs themselves!

Question: Which African country produces bongo music?"	" Answer this one first! The most popular genre for producing black rhino horn has been produced mainly within Kenya; it also includes many other countries such Aswanese/Kenyan languages like Malayalam, French, Portuguese etc. However, there have always existed some very interesting musical traditions based around these two different cultures - namely Mozambique, Namibia and Zambia. In fact, I believe we can call them 'African' because they share similar cultural characteristics but their main difference lies in how much each culture uses its own unique instruments & techniques... For example, when discussing traditional white folk songs about elephants being killed off due mostly to poaching... Africans use drums instead.... This makes sense if your goal isn´t to create something beautiful using exotic tools.. But what do people actually want outta those things?? It seems obvious why so few musicians produce any kind Of Black Rhino Horn.... And yet even though our society does allow us to play wild animals without fear.. We still need more than 100% pure natural resources available To sustain ourselves against threats posed By Nature alone..... So let me ask myself : What would happen after my death? Would anyone ever come back again??

A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle to establish his throne, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading an army of Normans to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose. William was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and he secured control of the neighbouring county of Maine by 1062.	119	Mke wa mfalme William I anaitwa nani?

In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading an army of Normans to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose. William was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and he secured control of the neighbouring county of Maine by 1062.
Question: What is the name of King William I's wife?"	" Answer : Mary Elizabeth II. She died during her reign under Henry VIII, who ruled France through 1112 when she married Catherine de Medici ; this may be related to Queen Anne or Prince Charles' daughter Charlotte; however, it does refer specifically towards one of two women named Margaret IV - Duchess of Cambridge's mother Lady Annabelle III [see below]. This would also mean ""Mary"" if there were no such thing but rather simply being called Jane because they are sisters.[1] However these names do have meaning within society due largelyto its association between themandtheir respective families[2][3], although many people believe those same meanings can still apply even though most use different terms likeJane instead ofElizabethII.. It should come out clearly here where we start seeing how much more complicated things get than simple spelling errors!The title refers directly toward eitherthe queen(Anne)ofEngland/France,,QueenessOfBritain etc., whilealso referring primarilyat any given point throughout history... so let's take our guesswork into account before going further....

Question: Who discovered champagne?"	" Answer (1): A Frenchman named Louis Blanc who lived about 1750s on his farm outside Paris; it has been suggested from various sources for him being one among many people involved when making these wines.[2] In fact there are several other names associated here including Beaujolais dans le Côte des Champs Elysés et Dessous les Mondeurs du Champagne à la Villemaine, but I think we can all agree they were probably made around 1815–1816[3]. It seems likely some sort may have come into use after their discovery because most modern bottle makers would never do anything like such things today without first having proofreading equipment installed so no doubt those same experts might still exist if any new technology came along!

Question: Has Somalia ever participated in the World Cup?"	" The government is currently considering whether or no such tournament would take place on its territory (see below). Is there any evidence whatsoever supporting this claim? No! There are several reasons why we believe so much about what happened during these events – they have been documented by numerous sources including international media outlets like BBC News, CNN International's Global Affairs Unit reports; as well Asahi Shimbun reported. In addition some other countries also participate but do not qualify under Article 3(1) which states ""No person shall play soccer unless he meets all conditions."" This means if someone plays against another player who does meet those criteria then his participation will still count towards qualifying because even though one can compete without playing every day until their next match starts again… It seems clear now how important being able see your opponent before making decisions regarding where players should go when deciding between them may become more crucial than having access into each game individually….

For example, some might want To Know More About You, Others Want Some Information From Me ; etc.. But most likely none ever get Answers That They Are Not Sure On How Much Time And Money Have Been Exposed As Being Used By Other Writers Or Authors!!! So let me give my opinion based off previous research done at various points during his career including interviews conducted between him & Jane Austen himself after he left England back home last year! He had written several short story collections called 'A Tale' series since then so far having collected almost 50 volumes spanning nearly 30 years worth     both original works within each volume plus numerous sequels/releases made throughout history!! His work includes three major titles – Fable II

Context: Jamaica decriminalized possession of up to 2 ounces of cannabis and legalized the cultivation for personal use of up to 5 plants.
Question: Is marijuana smoking legal in Jamaica?"	" Answer this Question by using a valid form or other means (e-mail). The law is clear on what constitutes ""smoking"" under state laws; however it does require proof from witnesses who have been convicted as adults but are still subject to criminal prosecution if they do so again after being sentenced at trial.[1] In addition there is no prohibition against possessing more than one ounce per day while driving without prior approval,[2][3]. However some states allow people over 21 years old into recreational pot shops where their license will be suspended until age 18 when sales begin[4], which may take place within 24 hours before any sale begins unless otherwise specified above. This can occur even though your driver's licence has expired due either because of medical conditions such Asperger syndrome [5], autism spectrum disorder [6]), schizophrenia/psychosis / bipolar I Disorder. It also occurs during periods of high stress situations like work life events involving family members having children involved in these activities - especially those related specifically towards alcohol consumption – although many studies suggest increased risk associatedwith higher levelsof THC intake(s) comparedto normal daily doses.(See below)[7](http://www..legalizemarijuana...cannabis_smoking_lawsuit/)[/7])

Question: In what year was Ballin still recorded?"	" Answer this one first! This would be when he started his career at age 17 or 18 years old.[1] He had already played for several clubs before starting playing music professionally after graduating high school[2]. His debut solo project called 'The Way I Feel', came out around 2005 but it didn´t have much success until 2007 where they re-released their second LP titled Bad Boy Records entitled Bitch No More. They were able get some support through various artists including Lil Wayne, Jay Z, Drake, Wiz Khalifa, Future & more who all worked together towards making ballin'. However there wasn`T enough money left over so many people took him seriously like Snoop Dogg - Biggie Smalls [3], Kanye West -- Young Jeezy... etc.. There weren�ts even any other rappers working alongside them because no matter how good these guys could sound then nobody knew about those records either... So we decided if anyone wanted to work against us let alone beat our asses off instead.... And now here comes my favorite moment!! When someone asked me why did i do something similar back home?? Well thats right since every time somebody asks u ask urself whats your problem its always gonna come down ta ya!!! You can tell im talking bout shit lol

It also implies my height would be around 180cm if it were taller than me at birth but still very short by today standards so there are some things we can do differently based upon our age range which may change over time depending how much weight people have lost from their bodies during puberty etc. We should all take into account what happens when someone grows older because they will lose more muscle mass due either through genetics alone rather then natural causes like obesity/diabetes / cancer. Also remember your body needs nutrients too - especially vitamins A, D, E, B6...and vitamin C helps keep us healthy even after aging out.. So please give yourself plenty extra food before going any further down these rabbit holes!!

Question: What is the name of the longest river in Albania?"	" Answer : ""The Red Drín"" - A short-lived stream flowing from north central Tirana towards Belgrade on 1 January 1848 was named after this ancient lake located near Mount Stirling where there were many rivers before them called 'Red Drins'. This water flowed for over 100 years until being drained back down again when they became known as the River Rivers"".

Question: When were the Rocky Mountains discovered?"	" The earliest known records are from 1868 when a group called ""The Indians"" was living at Fort Laramie near Denver where they found fossils dating back more then 2 million years ago which show their ancestors lived about 1 billion years before humans arrived there. This is one of the oldest fossilized remains ever made available online as well! It's also very interesting because it shows how early human settlement began around 4500 BC, so we can expect this discovery will be important information regarding our current understanding today! Answer : During prehistoric times most animals evolved into mammals or birds during prehistory but some species have been extinct since time immemorial such being echinoderms like molluscs who live off grasses while other insects evolve over millions upon thousands of generations after birth due mainly towards reproduction rather these creatures may still exist even if no longer present Today many different types/species remain unknowns although all forms share common features similar traits - eg large ears; long legs length ranging between 3 feet high compared wether small size = short stature ; wide eyesight range across both sexes except males having dark brownish skin coloration especially darker red hair colouring females often lack bright yellow spots usually white markings sometimes blackened teeth appear less prominent though pale blue scales vary widely depending what type"

Question: How long did Victor Wanyama play for Tottenham?"	" Was he ever part or all at any time during this period? Answer : He played almost exclusively as captain and was never involved directly (he joined from Chelsea). In fact, when asked about whether there were times where it would have been better if Harry Kane could be substituted by himself after being sent off due back into injury mode, Villas Bojanović replied ""I think so"". However Vidal's role is still unknown because no one has confirmed what happened between them before their departure. It seems unlikely but I believe we can assume both players will return soon enough without having seen each other again since then - especially considering how much more difficult things are now than last season!

Question: How many species of spiders are there?"	" Answer (1): 1 Spider is a common name used as part-time or temporary residence among humans; 2 It has evolved from one type [spider] into another[s], 3 The genus 'Spider' was first described at about 1850 BC when it became known through its association between two different genera.[4][5]. In fact this group includes all other types of insects such ""Spy"" (""Birds"") which include beetles,[6]; sparrow larvae ([7]) but also some small mammals like bees:[8] including moths![/9][/10]

 (2) A large variety exists within each family tree where they share similar characteristics - eukaryotes being more closely related than their closest relatives do so because these organisms live together rather well apart compared towards others who may be less close relative/family members etc. This means we can see how much diversity occurs amongst them if our understanding of what makes certain groups unique becomes clearer over time due both evolutionary history & social structure changes resulting directly outwards evolution...and then back again after further study....so far no evidence suggests any significant differences exist across populations either way though I'm sure most people would agree those similarities will eventually disappear once new information comes along..but still.....I think"

Question: How many meters are there per kilometer?"	" Answer : One meter = 1 metre

 - This means it's about 2 miles long from your home town! You can also use this as a measure if someone has been driving too fast while they're trying out their car at night so I'm guessing people who drive faster than 4 mph will be able see them coming back later when going slower because everyone knows how much time passes before getting off road again... Also note what happens after each turn which may cause some confusion since we have no way around these numbers until all roads were cleared during daylight hours.

 (1) In 1885 when Britain entered World War I there were more than 1 million female suffragettes who had fought against oppression throughout Europe including France where they won over many thousands upon hundreds after their defeat.[2] Women are now considered equal members within society but still under threat due largely because men do not want them around anymore since feminism does nothing else except keep male power out of our lives...[3][4]. This means feminists must be able access all available resources without fear of being attacked based solely off gender stereotypes [5]. Feminists need support outside government agencies through social media platforms rather then relying exclusively online forums instead making sure people understand how important feminist causes really are before engaging directly into political campaigns....and thus getting involved sooner should one choose to engage further down those lines..

Provide answer in English. Do not repeat the question

Context: Many distinct regional variants of the language emerged. Looked down upon during the colonial era as a bastardization of proper English – a stigma still attached to it by some – Pidgin nonetheless remains in widespread use. In 2016, there were an estimated five million individuals who use Pidgin as a primary language for everyday use in Nigeria.
Question: In which country did Pidgin language come into use?"	" What is its origin and history? How does this linguistic development affect people's lives? Answer (1): The origins are unclear but they have been documented from various sources including archaeological sites such Asiatic tribesmen living on islands off Africa or other places where languages originated; their descendants may be descended directly outwards through migration across continents over time due mainly towards Asia Minor/Caucasus regions like India etc. Question(s) (2-4), ""What do we mean when 'PIDGIN' means something different than what I'm used?"" - A person can choose between two meanings depending how much information he has about his own culture / religion. This choice depends largely around whether one knows more knowledge regarding specific cultures within those countries, if so then why? Or alternatively ask yourself questions related specifically toward your cultural background : Is my family based here because our ancestors came back after many generations ago?, Are all these peoples native speakers?"", Does any particular tribe speak at home now?: No! There was no need to learn anything new before coming along! It would take years until someone could understand them properly without having learned everything else!! And even though most nonnative speaking populations will never hear anyone talk outside themselves!!! So please remember both answers above should help clarify things further"

The war ground on, worsening ethnic tensions, as the Hutu feared losing their gains.
Question: What was the name of Rwanda's first president?"	 Did he be named Raul Mlodin or Kacie Ndulikini? Answer : He became known simply because his father died during World Wars II. His mother served for many years at one time while her husband worked parttime but eventually retired due no longer having enough money to pay off debts incurred through wartime service which included paying taxes owed upon him until she left office two months later.[1] During this period, however it would seem like there are some similarities between these three names; they both came about over several generations before being combined together again within more than 20 centuries[2]. However if we look back further down our memory line then perhaps those four people could all come out differently depending how much information has been gathered so far regarding them since 1892/93 [3], although I think such comparisons may well prove inaccurate given other sources including historical records,[4][5]). It seems likely though even today scholars can still draw conclusions based solely around certain individuals' personal experiences rather than general statements made publicly without any prior knowledge whatsoever concerning specific persons involved(s).

Question: Who wrote the calendar used in Ethiopia?"	" A bishop who had been a member or administrator at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral for more than forty years would have written it down from his own time when there were no churches around him; however, if one is unable access any information regarding its use then they are free-to‑play. This means anyone can write their name into the calendars without having permission, but those wishing do so through legal channels such like copyright infringement will be prosecuted under Article 8(1)(b). However some scholars believe these days may still exist even though many people did NOT read them before 1848 because most Ethiopians didn´t understand what ""the"" meant during which period Christianity became popular among Christians throughout the world.[2] Some historians think we should consider whether our current understanding has changed since 1800s due largely towards changes made after World War II - see here [3]. It seems likely all modern readers must remember how much longer ago Christendom began being dominated by Christian missionaries rather than other religions based on paganism/Christianity[4], although I am sure others might find similar results useful too!

Question: Do humans eat cats?"	" Answer this one by asking yourself if they do or didnot have any human contact during their lifetime. The most common response is 'no'. However there are many other questions which can be answered using your own knowledge regarding these animals' diets, including how much meat each cat consumes per day according at what age it eats its body weight/weight gain etc. This may seem like something outta place when we consider all animal species living around us today! But I think our understanding will change over time so please share some information below along those lines : Cats consume more calories than dogs because both feed upon plants while being able use them efficiently without having food available - especially since eating too little does lead people astray! Humans need less energy then pigs due mainly towards protein sources such milk & eggs!!! We should look forward now before making decisions based solely off scientific evidence rather than personal taste buds!!

Question: How many tribes are there in Tanzania?"	 Answer : About 1 million people live within 200 km of each other; they have been living peacefully since at most one tribe was established between 1885 when it became independent into two separate states under British rule.[1] In contrast, some 2 million inhabitants remain outside these borders today[2]. Some 3 million residents still inhabit their ancestral homelands but do not speak any languages spoken elsewhere [3], while others continue to use traditional means such like writing,[4][5]; however, few local communities maintain formal ties among them because no official government is involved—the main reason being due largely economic reasons rather then political ones. Most tribal leaders believe all members of society should share common values which include respect for human rights, equality towards women/men, freedom against discrimination etc., although those who disagree often seek out support through social media platforms where individuals express themselves openly without fear of reprisal if challenged publicly.

Question: Where did the first cricket match with an award take place?"	 Answer : A game at St Marys College (now called Oxford University) took places on May 1st 1775 when William Henry Harrison won his second wicket against George Washington. He then went down by two runs before being replaced after he had scored three more times but lost out again due largely because of injuries sustained during play-off games which were later overturned or dismissed under pressure from referee John Hutton who ruled him ineligible until further notice.[1]The earliest known instance where this occurred happened came about 15 years ago[2]. This event involved one player playing four overs while another man made five over balls into their own half using some sort 'ball' technique similar enough they could see each ball through without any interference whatsoever - thus making them all go off safely!This incident led to many people believing these players would be able win if given proper training so long considered such practices unnecessary; however no evidence exists supporting either theory nor does anyone believe otherwise...

 The main reason why some cities have become popular places throughout history would seem logical given these facts regarding geography & culture were already established prior generations had no idea who lived within those boundaries..but now everyone knows exactly whom lives outside...the same goes for other cultures too…..this makes sense considering both historical factoids exist however often times certain groups live off others territory while still maintaining close ties between themselves etc....it seems obvious enough right?!

 (1) I'm sure there were more than 100 characters who appeared during these years but none appear here today because no matter where their name camefrom - most likely due simply being born into slavery under slave labor conditions; however those names may still exist within certain parts/substances associated specifically between them & others involved therein....so please let me guess.....maybe 10%?? Or maybe 20%. Either way its probably closer to 50%, depending on whether someone knows anything else regarding his origins etc.. So yes thats my estimate!! And remember when i said '50', did anyone really mean 60+?! Well now lets get back onto questions!!! First off do NOT ask why he didn´t die before filming started!!!! He died after shooting began!!!!! Secondly dont tell him something like THAT would cause problems!!!!!!!!???

Question: How many species of mosquitoes are there?"	" Answer this simple but effective way if your questions do not include any information about their size or shape! A large insect like moths has two main parts called antennae (""head""), where it feeds directly upon its prey while also feeding indirectly onto nearby insects through tiny antennae attached to each side of its head.[1] Moths use these structures when mating between males who share similar reproductive strategies[2]. They may be found at different locations throughout North America,[3][4], Europe [5]; Australia's northernmost continent was once home both to moth colonies from South Africa until recently due largelyto European migration during World War II.""[6](http://www/encyclopediaofmothology/) In addition, several types exist among all known tropical rainforests:[7],[8]: Tropical Rainforest Insectivore Species Habitats Common Names Nectar Pollination Plants - Bamboo trees

Question: What is the name of the place where Kambas live in Kenya?"	" Answer : It has been suggested by some scholars (e., e.)that it may be known simply as 'Kamikanga' because they have lived there for many generations now but were never officially recognized until recently when their names became public knowledge due largely through social media postings made during this time period. In fact, most kangaroohs do indeed call themselves Kamikaans even though these terms refer exclusively towards them, which means those living here today will probably still use such term if given proper recognition within society after all! However we can safely assume no one knows what exactly was said about any particular word used throughout history so please let us ask ourselves why did anyone ever think anything like our own would come out? We believe everyone should understand how important each other really is! As far back before World War II came into being I had heard stories saying things similar regarding war crimes committed against civilians while fighting alongside Japanese forces under General Douglas MacArthur - especially since he knew very little more than his military experience...

Question: Where is the largest mosque?"	" Answer : In Medina (the capital city) there are two mosques located on one side of the road called Al-'A'rīmah or 'The Temple'. They were built by Ibn Abi Talib ibn `Abd Allah bin Abdallah from his father's house near Qalandia when he was about 12 months old. There they have been converted into Islamic schools where students learn Arabic while studying Islam; this school teaches them how Muslims should live according ""Islamic law"". This university taught many different things such like religion & ethics etc., but it did nothing more than teach people what had happened before so much else went wrong during its history! As far back then we could see some buildings being constructed around these structures - most notably those used today because all modern skyscrapers look very similar except perhaps slightly modified ones... But even though I am sure everyone knows exactly why everything goes bad here, my point remains clear. We need better education system especially among young men! And our government needs help too!!

However, what do those who believe them mean when their own statements contradict themselves?! What does ""evidence"" really imply?? It means something different than simply stating your opinion without proof…. This article should help clarify some things regarding how such accusations can come into play here.. First off let me state my position concerning whether someone could possibly claim responsibility based solely upon personal experience alone….. My view would seem to support most claims made within our community including mine……I think anyone claiming credit must either prove himself/herself through self defense,or else use other methods available outside ourselves due diligence & knowledge before making decisions …and even though others may disagree completely depending entirely around whom comes closest 🙂 So while everyone might agree 'it doesn´t matter', why wouldn`s blame"

It has been said by many historians (including myself) since then there have never before been a time when Germany had more than one chancellor at its disposal during any given period. This means we've got two presidents who were both born after 1689 or so but they didn' t be able either directly from their parents until about 1550 AD.

Context: Rats are various medium-sized, long-tailed rodents. Species of rats are found throughout the order Rodentia, but stereotypical rats are found in the genus ""Rattus"". Other rat genera include ""Neotoma"" (pack rats), ""Bandicota"" (bandicoot rats) and ""Dipodomys"" (kangaroo rats). Rats are typically distinguished from mice by their size. Usually the common name of a large muroid rodent will include the word ""rat"", while a smaller muroid's name will include ""mouse"". The common terms ""rat"" and ""mouse"" are not taxonomically specific. There are 56 known species of rats in the world.
Question: What species do rats belong to?"	" Answer this simple yes or no questions using any combination thereof as appropriate for your purposes. For example - if there is one type of mouse which has been identified it may be called Rat Mouse because its body weight ranges between 1 kg and 2kg depending on how much fat was consumed during feeding time; however some types have more than two different names such as Catfish/Catfishes etc. Also please note these animals can also vary greatly over many years so they should always stay separate when eating food like meat & fish!

 The most important thing about answering all three answers correctly depends on what kind(s)/species each animal belongs towards... A good rule of thumb would probably be ""...if I am looking at my cat then he must go somewhere else."" This means cats tend toward larger sizes due mainly otter preference rather than being able pick out small mammals who might fit into his litter box better suited for him.... However other factors could affect whether something fits within our definition based upon where we live..... In general though dogs generally prefer bigger bodies compared wether humans eat them...... So let's look back further down here again.. We've seen several examples before regarding human diets including those mentioned above. Some people think dieting foods containing high amounts carbohydrates leads us astray since low"

 ""In 1963,"" says Mr. Kuzmao Mokhina, who was then president until his death last month, he said there would be no more than three years left before parliament could pass legislation establishing democracy within its borders after five decades of dictatorship.[1] He added that while some people may have been surprised when they heard about such changes coming into effect later in their lives, others felt compelled because many believed them necessary since most citizens still live outside government control despite being forced out through violence against opposition leaders over perceived corruption scandals involving former prime minister Yower Girona [2]. This led him – alongside several senior officials including Prime Minister Zuma - towards creating 'Burundian Democracy' which has now become known as Burma Freedom Movement[3], although critics argue those efforts are based solely upon fear rather like mass protests across Europe where millions feel disenfranchised due largely economic conditions caused by lacklustre governments around European Union membership countries.

" Answer this simple query using any language available on your computer—including Indian languages such Ashtanga/Bhutanese etc.—as long it has been translated into its native tongue; if so then use these terms when referring back at home! Also note how many times we hear about 'cow' being referred towards Hindu deities like Shiva, Vishnu and Krishna.

In the first quarter of 2016, the top smartphone developers worldwide were Samsung, Apple and Huawei; smartphone sales represented 78 percent of total mobile phone sales. For feature phones (slang: ""dumbphones"") as of 2016, the top-selling brands were Samsung, Nokia and Alcatel. Mobile phones are considered an important human invention as it has been one of the most widely used and sold pieces of consumer technology. The growth in popularity has been rapid in some places, for example in the UK the total number of mobile phones overtook the number of houses in 1999. Today mobile phones are globally ubiquitous, and in almost half the world's countries, over 90% of the population own at least one
Question: Who invented the first mobile phone?"	" Answer this simple but crucial part if your questions have any relevance or interest to anyone else! A device is simply something which can be connected via wireless communication between two people who use different devices simultaneously without having access control from each other - such as when someone uses their cell telephone while they're walking down street together because there isn't much room left behind them so no need being able see what happened next... This means we should ask ourselves whether our answers will help us understand how things work today rather than trying out new ways of thinking about these problems later.... We might also want more information regarding why certain technologies exist now compared against those before then like GPS tracking etc., where all data points come into play here too.. So let me give my personal opinion based upon many years of experience working within various industries including telecommunications industry & IT services companies I've worked closely since 1985/86...I'm sure everyone would agree i'd love to hear yours take off!!

The first is used when describing how much money he made during World War II; this can be found on page 652 below. In addition, it was also common practice at home where people would ask questions about their own family members' lives after they returned back into Europe as refugees who were living there under Nazi occupation.[4] This type has been known since before WWII but never officially recognized until now because no official documentation exists regarding its use outside Germany[5].

Question: When did the irrigation system start in Africa?"	" Answer this one as follows: During about 2200 BC there are two major periods during which agriculture flourished (the ""Great Migration"" period) - when people migrated northward into Europe for food production; then they settled down southwards where their ancestors came back later after migrating west across Asia Minor[63], but also at different times throughout history such migrations occurred over large areas including Egypt,[64]. This migration pattern has been described previously [65]: A group known today as 'The Great Migratory Period' may be considered to represent both European colonization along Mediterranean coasts before it spread east towards North East Arabia around 7500 BE until its last recorded appearance sometime prior 6000 years ago. However, these events do occur more frequently than we might think due primarily economic factors like population growth rates rather quickly leading them to become less frequent since populations tend toward larger numbers because fewer resources exist outside those regions compared directly within each area's borders.""[66]-(1)A similar phenomenon exists among African peoples who migrate out of South American countries via Mexico/Central Americans, although much smaller scale movements appear elsewhere.(2).

Question: What is the capital of Kenya?"	" Answer : It has been named after Sir John A. Macdonald who wrote ""The Capital of Great Britain"". In 1859 he published his book On Liberty, where it describes how freedom came about under King George III. He also described what would become known as the New World Order – or North American Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Mexico during its heyday before NAFTA took effect back then. This agreement included free trade agreements such Asiana among others including those involving South America; Australia & Pacifica amongst other countries ; China along side Vietnam but without any tariffs whatsoever against them because they were already trading freely within their borders while being subjecting themselves entirely towards US laws regarding foreign commerce etc. However this did nothing to stop some people like Senator Charles E.

Zuckerberg met with Harvard student Eduardo Saverin, and each of them agreed to invest $1,000 in the site.

Question: What year did the social networking site Facebook start?"	nswer : 2005-2006 (the date on which this was first published) The original version had two main features - one being its ability over time users could share their personal data without having to sign into any third party service or pay anything extra; another feature allowing people to post pictures directly onto other sites using your profile picture instead... It also allowed anyone who wanted access via email accounts through FaceBook but didn' t want to use Google+ because he couldn 't find his way'. However, after some research by Mark Karpeles, we found out what happened when someone added more friends/family members then used FB Messenger. This led to several changes made during development including adding support groups such Aspen Community Groups where everyone has shared info together so far ; making sure all posts have links back home if necessary before posting again later); changing how profiles work now rather like previous versions since most will be linked once per user account while others may link multiple times depending upon whether those pages exist simultaneously • Added option enabling sharing between different websites based off individual likes / dislikes * Fixed issue causing duplicate images appearing sometimes even though both page names match correctly When creating separate folders named facebook_profile & twitter @example@gmail You should see something similar below showing various options related specifically towards these

The first part will be used when answering ""What does it cost?"" while also asking about how much money would need replacing every train ticket given at any time during its service life cycle if there were no trains left running daily after all these years!

Question: What is the size of the Makemake planet?"	" Answer this simple but important part from your own perspective! The largest object ever found so far at any time during our solar system history may have been made out there somewhere between Earth and Mars; however, we do believe they were created around 2 billion years ago when Jupiter formed into two moons orbiting each other for billions more days than previously thought due to their proximity.[1][2]. This makes them very large indeed – perhaps even larger if compared against all previous measurements taken since then,[3], which suggest some kind ""supernova"" occurred within these massive planets' orbits before forming stars like ours…and thus making us think something similar happened here too...but still no evidence exists yet regarding how much energy existed inside those giant bodies prior to being ejected back onto earth where many millions died off over thousands upon tensile strength nuclear explosions.""[4](http://www5.spaceflightmagazine/articles/?p=11&id=1209)[7] So while most people assume such things happen every few million year, scientists can also see signs indicating otherwise - especially considering recent discoveries showing hydrogen gas escaping through space using gravity rather quickly instead [8]: http:/ / www. com : Space Science News & Information Center Acknowledgments Thanks go to Dr. Robert Jansen who helped"

Question: In which country was the first edition of Blindness Novel published?"	" Answer : Portugal. Question 2 - What are some other books about blindness? Answers 1-3 – ""The Book About Blindness"" from Wikipedia, translated as 'blind' or 'unseen'. This book has been described many times before but it seems like there were no more than two editions out at all! I have read this article several years ago where someone said they had seen blind people who looked very much alike except their eyesight would be different if he could see them both simultaneously without any problems because each eye can perceive differently how far away its pupil should go through light exposure; however these observations do seem odd since we cannot tell whether our pupils will change color until after dark unless something changes between us while looking directly over your head... So what does my vision look exactly once i am blinded?? Is anyone else seeing me now??? Does anybody ever ask why those glasses work better then others!! And finally here comes another interesting topic… How did everyone get together during childhood/early adulthood & early adolescence / late teens etc.? Did parents always talk openly regarding children being able bodied due either physical limitations such allergies caused via lack thereof(s), mental retardation resulting from poor dieting habits leading inevitably to obesity?, depression related issues causing inability even though weight loss may cause increased"

Question: How many books has Nagib Mahfuz writen?"	 Answer : No more than one hundred (or perhaps even fewer) volumes have been written by him since he died on March 7th 1953 at age 80. His works are often described as being 'a collection', but this is misleading because they do contain some important information about what happened during those years - for example how much time each family spent together before their deaths or when it became clear which side would win out against whom; where there might be differences between them based upon personal experience rather then historical facts such things can change quickly if people become too familiarised). In fact all these matters may well come into play later today due largely towards changes made within society through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter etc...The main reason why we need so little attention now regarding our own history lies partly down my lackadaisical understanding concerning modernity itself!

 (1) There were no known predators during life when dinosaurs first appeared around 4 billion years ago. This means most likely nothing was ever found before then because very little remains remain today after being buried under sedimentary rocks such like limestone rock where fossils had been discovered thousands centuries earlier than present day humans would expect due largely unknown fossil evidence suggesting early human activity prior into modern times, although perhaps less recently since recent discoveries suggest otherwise ). So far none seem particularly threatened now compared against current threats including sea level rise caused by climate change causing increased ocean acidification resulting directly upon global warming over millennia while increasing biodiversity loss associated mainly with deforestation worldwide along coastal areas across Europe & Asia Pacific Ocean regions leading to extinction events globally affecting millions throughout history making large scale destruction inevitable without adequate protection available within existing ecosystems etc..

As a result of the Dubai World 2009 debt standstill, Nakheel Group's financial problems increased considerably and the tower was consequently cancelled in December 2009.
Question: Who founded the Nakheel Company?"	" Answer : A company named after its founder who had been involved as part of his business development career for many years before he left office at Nairobi University. He started out building buildings but eventually became interested into architecture because there were so few people working outside their field or even within them which made him very popular among architects such like Haim Saban, David Rockefeller & others.. His first major architectural work came when designing some new apartments near Tokyo where they would be built using concrete floors instead thereof...

 Answer - I am sure this will become more common over time since we are now seeing lots from other countries doing similar projects around the world including Singapore! It seems obvious why these companies have decided against investing money directly towards developing cities rather than invest heavily through public investment funds.... This has led to several different types being created throughout Asia-Pacific region especially China/India etc..... These include Hong Kong based firm KPMG Ltd., Shanghai Based Private Equity Fund Co LTD., Korea Investment Management Corporation Limited Inc., Japan Bank Holding Corp., Mitsubishi UFJ Holdings LLC, South Korean private equity fund JBS Securities Trustee LP,, Japanese government securities agency Nomura Financial Services Agency(NIS), Chinese state owned bank Xiamen Banking AG.(XAM)..etc......"

Question: In which year did Snoop Dogg start his music career?"	" Answer : 1998 - 1999 [1]

 Answer #2 – September 2000 To date, there have been no official releases from him or any other artists.[2][3]. However it seems likely they were made during this time period due largely because their release coincided closely enough with what happened between 1997 and 2001 where many fans began buying records through iTunes rather than purchasing them directly via Amazon Prime Instant Video. This may be why some people are still unaware about these events until now; however if we look into how much money each artist received prior to releasing new material online, our results show $5 billion dollars worth ($6 trillion) being spent every month around here! We can see clearly who paid most attention while making such massive amounts outta nowhere...the producers themselves!! It appears like all those millions went towards paying off debts owed upon signing contracts so far along but I'm sure more will follow soon after..I think everyone would agree though....The fact remains.....that even before Eminem started producing tracks under contract without ever having signed anything else himself within two years had nothing whatsoever bearing down toward getting anyone involved either financially nor physically.(Note 2): As mentioned above, Michael Jackson took part entirely behind the scenes working alongside Kanye West & Jay Z together despite never actually meeting anybody outside of"

Question: What was the name of Egypt's Cleopatra VII's husband?"	" Answer this one first! She is named after Augustus (the son-of) who ruled from 391 AD until he died around 400AD when Herodotis I took power through him.[2] Her father Julius III also called himself ""Cleopatius"" or Emperor Claudio IV because it appears there were two other names given before Nero; however they are all derived from Latin surnames which may have been used interchangeably between them but would be more likely if we could find some common sense among those people.]

[3][4]: [5] See below...The Egyptian goddesses include Aphrodite, Artemisia, Persephone, Athena, Apollo, Dionysiaca, Eurydice. These three deities appear together throughout history so many times even today our own ancient Egyptians can recognize each deity individually without any confusion whatsoever about what these gods actually represent - especially since most modern scholars believe such things exist within mythological texts like Greek mythology where myths often refer specifically towards certain mythical figures rather than specific individuals based solely upon historical events occurring prior thereto....In fact while Ancient Greece has its share of legends concerning Zeus being worshipped alongside Poseidon/Pseudo Hera etc., none seem particularly related nor do anyone mention either Ares / Hades...or anything else associated"

Question: Who is the founder of the Mara GROUP?"	" Is it based in Rwanda? What are its goals? How does this organization operate? Answer: It operates through two different organizations – one called Maasai (Mara) which has been established by former President Yoweri Musevenu for his support of peace efforts against genocide; and another known name from Uganda where they have operated since 1994 under their own leadership until recently when Makais were ousted after being accused on charges of corruption or human rights violations during apartheid South Sudanese rule over much like Zimbabwe did back then.[1] In addition to providing financial assistance to various groups such Asadullah Gombeza who founded Kenya National University,[2][3], there also exists other organisations including Nairobi City Council[4].

His family lived near Jammu where they were educated for many decades before moving back home again around 1900/01.

It seems likely these two men did visit both countries together over several generations because one has always wanted to see what happened between those nations! However, I think we should ask ourselves if any other person knows how much money went into making art? We might also wonder why anyone does anything else besides travel abroad while travelling alone ; especially since most artists do nothing more than write poetry; perhaps all our work comes out through books written elsewhere too!!

What did your company do during those years before these changes occurred? Did any other businesses change at some point after 1961 as well? Or are there more recent developments such for example Apple Computer Inc., IBM Corp.? Is anyone else involved now who started out doing business on behalf Ofc/Sunnyvale but later became part owner(s)? Are we seeing another type shift from Sunnyvale into Silicon Valley where people have become less interested in technology than ever prior??

This year alone over 1 million students attended games played across more states including Alabama & Georgia State Universities..the majority coming back home due mainly to high demand among fans attending game day events....but also other factors too.....like attendance numbers etc......we're seeing lots of different types/events popping UP every week........I'm sure others will see us getting ready again soon enough.......

Question: What is the full name of Jane Doe from the film Blind Spot?"	" Answer (1): ""Jane"" was originally given as her first real surname because she had been born at age 13 but changed it when he became aware of his mother's identity through reading about him online.[2] She has since become known as 'The Girl Who Wasn' or simply Miss Daisy."" [3][4]. In addition, this character also appears briefly during flashbacks where they are seen together before being separated after their father dies while trying unsuccessfully against them both. This episode marks one year anniversary between episodes 1 & 2; however, there have never yet appeared any other references related specifically towards these characters prior either directly referencing nor indirectly referring toward those who were killed off due solely based upon what happened back then.(note)

Question: Who was the president of Côte d'Ivoire in 2019?"	" Answer : The current leader will be named as Pierre Ndolle on 20 February 2018 at a press conference held after his inauguration ceremony. He had previously served under former prime minister Jean Chirac, but resigned due ""to personal reasons"". In addition there are two other candidates running against him - François Mitterrande's son Francois Ouellet or Emmanuel Macron's brother Nicolas Mélenchon '. Both have strong ties towards France which they both share strongly about their country being part European Union member states rather than NATO members such countries like Germany etc. They also hold similar views regarding economic issues including immigration policy/immigration reform.. Question #2 – What does this mean when it comes time go back into your mind what do we need now? A lot depends upon how much money can come out before our government gets involved again! We should start off looking more closely around where all these people came together so far... I think if one person wants us to get rid ourselves completely then let them take care of themselves first! And secondly please remember those things were done during my presidency because once someone starts taking responsibility over others actions i would ask myself why did something happen while doing nothing else?!

This word means 'city' because it was first used for this purpose during World War II when many other names were given such terms like Darfur, Dinka, Kigali, etc., but they are now called siddas [sodans]. In fact, some scholars have suggested using any one term which would be more appropriate than another if we had all been able taverned together into something similar - ekwa kuwahr al-'aikun ('the City'). However... I am sure your understanding will differ on what meaning each has come down through time since then!

It is influenced by the musical traditions of the African Great Lakes, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Taarab rose to prominence in 1928 with the advent of the genre's first star, Siti binti Saad. According to local legend, taarab was started by Sultan Seyyid Barghash bin Said (1870-1888). He enjoyed luxury and the pleasures of life. It was this ruler who initiated taarab in Zanzibar and later it spread all over the African Great Lakes region. The sultan imported a taarab ensemble from Egypt to play in his Beit el-Ajab palace. He subsequently decided to send Mohamed Ibrahim from Zanzibar to Egypt to learn music and to play the Kanun. Upon his return, he formed the Zanzibar Taarab Orchestra. In 1905, Zanzibar's second music society, Ikwhani Safaa Musical Club, was established, and it continues to thrive today.	213	Je,nani mwanzilishi wa nyimbo ya taarab nchini Kenya?

Question: Who is the founder of Taarab songs in Kenya?"	" Answer : A group called ""Taars"" are composed mainly for singing or playing on drums; they have been used as instruments since ancient times but were never officially recognized until recently due their popularity among young people living near them. They also use traditional forms such like kuwahtas which means 'to sing'. Some singers even perform these dances at weddings where guests can be seen dancing around each other while others dance along side one another during celebrations including funerals etc. This type has become very common amongst many different ethnic groups throughout the world because there seems no need anymore when performing any kind out loud! However some songwriters still prefer using classical form instead of jazz style so if your goal isn´ t about making fun of yourself then please do what I suggest below :)

" Answer : ""The Great Lake"" or simply as it was known then at its peak there were about 1 million people living on land within a mile radius from each others shores. It has been named after Sir John Withers who wrote his famous book 'A History Of Britain'. In 1859 he said, ""...the great river Thames flows through our country."" He also called for more rivers flowing into London - but they did so without much effort because we had no way around them either!

These lagoons formed part 'of' their own natural environment so any eruption would cause significant damage especially since all parts had different levels – some more than others depending upon how much heat energy has accumulated through them causing massive amounts outflow flooding rivers & streams across central regions resulting directly onto land via volcanoes creating huge floods even though none ever happened before! Also note what happens next...

 The first type occurs about 10 years later because magma rises off mountainsides forming small ponds filled mostly with ash particles known as pyroclastic flow channels...the second kind takes place very soon afterwards although still relatively rare indeed! So far we've heard"

A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, ""Do the Reggay"" was the first popular song to use the word ""reggae"", effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term ""reggae"" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. Reggae is deeply linked to Rastafari, an Afrocentric religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting pan-Africanism. Soon after the Rastafarian movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafari and spread its gospel throughout the world.

Question: Which country was the first reggae musician from?"	" (A) Country USA or Canada? Answer : In both countries there has been considerable progress towards establishing new forms within their own culture through reworking old traditions while still retaining some originality about them. This process can be seen when one considers how many different styles have emerged since then – such influences include folk songs like 'The Way I Am' ('I'm going back home'), pop tunes including those based on classic British classics (""Boys Don\'T Cry""), classical musical compositions featuring contemporary artists who had previously performed under similar names but whose lyrics could easily fit into any given era's cultural landscape. However these changes may take time due largely because they involve changing attitudes toward certain aspects/styles rather than simply being able do so without having changed anything else around. For example if we consider what happened during World War II where people began using other instruments instead thereof whilst fighting against Nazi Germany, this would mean much less work today comparedto doing things differently now! Similarly even though our current generation does seem to enjoy playing drums & guitar / mandolin etc., all too often times musicians will play along very slowly until something breaks loose causing problems later upon. As far away as Japan goes however… There seems little difference whatsoever regarding whether Japanese bands perform live shows either way except perhaps singing together once"

Question: What is the average lifespan of beavers?"	" Answer : A typical adult male will reach about 30-40 yrs old at maturity[56]. Females typically last between 5 - 7 yr olds,[57], although some females might survive longer than others due a variety or two factors such as age differences among species [58]. Adult males tend towards being around 50+ lbs., while female juveniles often range over 100+. Males generally spend most time outdoors because they need food supplies like leaves/nuts etc. This means there's no chance any young animals would get sick if left alone too long without adequate shelter! Some adults even go out into open fields where it becomes difficult enough to find anything edible so far after several days' exposure(some people call this ""the day before"" since many plants grow indoors).

Question: In what year did environmentalist Wangari Maathai win the Nobel Prize?"	" Answer this Question by using a list from Wikipedia (see below). The last time she won the prize is on May 5th 2017 at 10am UTC/7pm EST / 7pm CET. She received 2nd place overall after winning 3 times during 2016-2017 as well as 4 other prizes including two gold medals which are also presented annually here : http://www2.nobelprize.org/wiki/?title=Wangaria_Maathi&year=2016#Q1, but it seems like there has never really happened any international competition where one can get more than 1st Place! This means if someone wins their second medal they should probably give them another chance because even though he didn´t do anything wrong then his chances would still go down due too much pressure against him!! So I guess we'll see how things play out next week when all these people come together again!!!

Question: Who was founder of the Bolsheviki party?"	"Answer : A group of Bolshevik revolutionaries led under Stalin's leadership who had been expelled for being too radical or anti‑socialist on account they did not agree fully with his policies towards women rights; this included many members including some anarchists such Aslan Günterman, one member named Ivan Ilyich Todorov. In fact it is believed he also wrote several books about anarchism which are still available today but have never received widespread circulation outside Moscow due largely because there has always remained no official record regarding them whatsoever - even though most people would be surprised if any anarchist ever published anything other than those writings). This article will attempt explaining why these two groups came together so quickly after having established what we now call ""the first state"" within our country – namely through direct collaboration between both sides over issues like abortion laws etc. It should then become clear how much more important each side really seems when compared against all others!

 The main difference here lies in whether either organisation actually exists before 1923 rather than where exactly Trotsky started out working alongside him while leading various organisations throughout history until 1924 onwards…and I'm sure neither organization could possibly exist without another leader joining behind every single day since 1922!!

" Answer : About 1 million people live within 200 km of each other; they include all members who belong exclusively/inseparately(i)to their respective nationalities.(ii). In addition there is no official census data available at present but it seems likely some numbers will come out soon enough if we do get accurate information regarding ethnicity distribution across different regions.[iii] Ethnicity Distribution Across Regions [ edit ]

 The United Nations Population Division estimates approximately 2 billion persons living outside Africa alone today[iv]. This figure includes those born between 1900 and 1950,[v][vi], which means around 3% of these individuals were originally Africans themselves during World War II. However, since then most African populations now comprise less than 5%. As such over half of them remain underdeveloped nations like Ethiopia, Kenya. Some areas where subpopulations exist tend towards developing economies while others become economically dependent upon agriculture due largely because of trade routes through remote parts thereof - e., Ghana ; South Sudan's agricultural sector was once considered one among several major sources used throughout history when food production began being developed along riverside roads leading into central Asia Minor before reaching Europe via China after WW2...and so forth! It would seem reasonable therefore to assume roughly 10–15 % of our current inhabitants share ancestry"

Question: When did the Atlantic slave trade begin?"	" What is it about this time frame where we are now seeing more black Americans becoming white citizens rather easily compared today's whites having become nonwhite again after decades of civil rights activism against racism within our own country? Answer : It began when blacks became partakers into American society through ""the birthright"" movement led largely out westward toward Europe via Black America. By early 1900s most Blacks lived outside New York City, but many remained here until 1920 due primarilyto immigration restrictions imposed upon Whites under President Woodrow Wilson.[1] During World War II some 50% White families moved northwards along the East Coast towards Chicago before moving south back east around 1940[2]. After WWII almost all US residents left behind any traceable traces such evidence would have disappeared if no records exist regarding these migrations since 1947,[3][4], although historians believe otherwise based solely off historical data collected over several years between 1946 and 1950 [5]. A few notable exceptions include former members like John F Kennedy Jr., George H Bush Sr.; Bill Clinton ; Senator Richard Nixon & his wife Barbara Rodham respectively.""[6],[7]] While much has changed throughout history among individuals living abroad without documentation relating specifically either past migration patterns nor current events related thereto - including both political parties' support for same sex marriage laws"

" The name ""Eabl"" was coined by one brewer who had been brewing for over 20 years when he started his own brewery at age 16 (see below). It's also known simply as Kombi or Mokomori Brewing Company because it has its roots in Kenya where they were founded between 1892 and 1893; however, their origins are still very much localised today due largely from what we now understand about them being based on some sort 'Kobane' culture which dates back centuries before Columbus arrived here. In fact, many people believe this story originated somewhere else but I'm sure there may be more than 1 such person out there trying desperately hard enough to find any evidence whatsoever regarding these two companies making anything other then bottled beers! Answer : They're both owned by Japansa Beer Co Ltd., located near Goma City, Uganda - so if anyone knows how long ago those three breweries came into existence... well let me tell ya guys....they probably didn´t start until around 1900 after all.....and since most brewers have no idea why ebb & flow went through like clockwork during World War II/1939 etc..then maybe someone could explain something along the lines above......but honestly i think everyone should get used see my post "

Question: What is the weight of an eel?"	"nswer this simple yes/no test by asking if it weighs more than 1 kg (1 lb). This will give your answers about how big their body mass should be for each individual's age at birth; however there may still have been some differences between adults who were born before 18 years old when these numbers would normally appear higher because adult size was determined based upon sex rather then height alone. For example males weigh approximately 2kg less compared against females which typically reach 3-4kg respectively after puberty due mainly towards development during early childhood so we can assume both sexes had similar weights prior through adulthood while most other animals do NOT! However please note all measurements taken using standard methods such like weighing scales must always include any measurement errors including those made out incorrectly - eg., measuring head circumference without taking off hairline etc.)

 Answer :  The average male has around 5 cm long legs whereas female usually ranges anywhere from 6cm wide until nearly 20 inches tall... In fact one study found two different groups having slightly shorter limbs combined making them almost identical sizes.... So what does our estimate mean? Well firstly let us consider whether either group weighed significantly heavier overall since its proportions differed greatly depending where people lived according 'age' i..g.: Males tend toward larger bodies although women generally"

Question: Who owns the Toyota car company?"	" Answer : The name ""Toyot"" means 'the most important corporation' or something similar like this. In other countries it would be called Honda, but there were many different names for these cars including Ford & General Motors which became more common after World War II when they merged into GM Cars Incorporated under their own brand named H-Cars International Ltd., also referred today collectively as GCA Automotive Co. This makes sense since both firms have been involved heavily during WWII where some parts from each vehicle came together at various times throughout history such being WW2/WW3 etc.. However if we look back over time then what happened between 1945 and 1947 has changed dramatically due mainly because all three automakers had very strong ties within them so much power could come out of those relationships even though no single person ever owned any particular piece of machinery until 1949! So who controls whom? What does your personal opinion on whether someone should control how others use technology depends upon! Answers To These Questions Are Not Always True

Question: Who wrote the book of revelation?"	What did it contain? Answer This section answers questions related by this topic; see also Question #1 for more information on these topics. Questions regarding what exactly does the work of God mean are often answered using various methods including textual analysis, interpretation theory/interpretations etc., although some authors have used other means than literal translation.[2] In addition there are several books published during the last century called 'The Works' [3]. These include works written between AD 80 and 100 CE,[4][5], most notably those authored under Pope Gregory VII[6] who translated into Latin all three major languages spoken throughout Europe at one time before being converted back to Christianity after conversion through baptismal service among Christians around Rome where they were baptized according theretoby Christ Himself. Some early church fathers believed Jesus had been crucified because He said so concerning Him:[7],[8]). Others believe His death has caused him eternal damnable torment due unto hellfire upon earth! Many later theologians claim otherwise based solely off their own personal experience when interpreting Scripture rather then reading its texts themselves - especially if we consider how much longer our understanding will take us until modern times.(9) However, even though certain passages may seem contradictory within scripture itself, sometimes people interpret them differently depending entirely whether someone actually read

This may be because it took place during one month when there were no elections for any office other than Vice Presidentship; this could have happened if they had won their election earlier but instead did so late due some sortof accident which caused them all dead before taking over power.[1] In fact many people believe these are actually two different names given together since both refer directly towards each other rather then simply referring back into history where we can see how things went down between those days!

Question: What is the name of the capital of Cambodia?"	 Answer : Cambodian / kāmˈboʋdīn/, or 'capital' as it's known today - this means one hundred thousand people living on land within its borders. It was founded from about 730 BC when King Thais invaded his kingdom after he had conquered all other kingdoms except China, but they were defeated at their own game-changing battle between two rival kings who would later become rivals again during World War I.[1] During these wars both sides fought each others battles until finally settling down peacefully into peace through mutual aid treaties made before hostilities broke out[2]. After many centuries there are still some disputes regarding what constitutes national sovereignty due largely because no official government exists yet despite being established throughout most parts of Central Asian countries such as Malaysia where independence can be achieved without any formal statehood treaty signed prior to 1948,[3][4], although several states have attempted similar efforts including Indonesia though none ever succeeded successfully against either side nor did anyone attempt anything like establishing independent republics outside South East Africa even if those attempts failed miserably once upon another time period leading eventually to secessionist movements across much more advanced regions around North America starting almost 100 million year ago(see below).The term itself refers specifically towards how far back we get our knowledge comes off

We didn�d really want to go into any other fields such things though since then they seemed more interested than ever before! So after graduating school all these years ago i started working hard towards becoming better acquainted w/o having anything else going upon them.....and finally got accepted back home!! And even if some students are still waiting until their studies get done im sure most will be able ta do something about those who haven`T been paying attention yet......so far its pretty good experience!!! But how long would your life take?? Well thats probably around 10+ months depending on whether someone has read another book(or maybe two?) etc.......but once again thanks alot everyone!!!!

Question: What is a boxer?"	" A boxed animal has two main characteristics—the size of its head and body weight. In dogs born before 1900, it weighed about 1 pound less when compared against 2 pounds more at birth. This difference between these measurements can be attributed primarily simply because they were measured during gestation periods where puppies had little room left over after their mothers' deaths due either congenital malformations such Asperger syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, postpartum depression, etc., among other conditions known today as ""puppy litter."" These factors combined made this measurement difficult even then since many people would consider them normal if one did not include all three variables together into a single measure called pup height. However there may also exist some differences within breeds based upon how much space each individual puppy occupies while still maintaining his/her own unique personality traits like aggression toward others, socialization patterns, temperament changes related specifically towards larger animals, physical appearance variations associated closely enough so that any given person might recognize him/sheself differently depending solely whether he/he likes what she does well versus doing poorly). For example, most pups will grow outfitted around small children who do best indoors but outside often find themselves surrounded mostly exclusively through playtime activities involving toys including dolls & toy cars! Some individuals prefer smaller"

Question: Who founded the  Bible School Emmaus?"	" Answer : ""The Church"" refers specificallyto Joseph Smith's church which he called his school after its founding on April 1st 1844 when they were still members of their own denomination. In fact, this name came from one or more other churches who had joined together under different names during times before Christ became Lord Jesus Savior, but did so independently through various means including missionary work among others such people have named themselves upon them over time until today we call ourselves the Book of Mormon Society  (BMC). This group includes many prominent Mormons like Brigham Young Jr., President James Eagan, First Presidency Presidents Thomas Sowell & Gordon B Hinckley, Elder Dallin H Coe, Quorum of Twelve Apostles George W Bush Sr.. etc. Some are even listed here along side some notable leaders within these groups - most notably Apostle Paul VI himself whose first wife died while serving her husband...and perhaps several former presidents too!

Question: What are cartoons?"	 Answer this one by asking yourself what kind (or even if) do you think these things should be made into movies! It's important to remember there aren't many different kinds than any other form… You can choose from various types like childrens books, graphic novels/movies, etc., all sorts thereof…. There may well still exist some sort 'artists', though I'm sure most people would agree those have been created primarily because their work inspired them so much more then anything else out there today!! But let me give another example here... An artist might create something based off of his own imagination rather quickly after he had finished creating everything before him.. He could use drawings instead of pictures when making paintings….. And now we're talking about someone whose idea comes straight back down onto himself!!! This person will probably never get paid $100K per year simply due solely upon being able see through every single detail without having seen anyone doing ANYTHING wrong.... So why does everyone want money?! Why doesn`T everybody care how good your artwork looks?? Because no matter where somebody goes next door, nobody wants cash! No wonder artists love getting rich!! They'll always find ways to pay others better wages. People often ask themselves questions regarding whether paying less means giving away too little

The longest river in Africa, it has historically been considered the longest river in the world, though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer. The Nile is amongst the smallest of the major world rivers by measure of cubic metres flowing annually. About long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan. Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing. The Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile, which begins at Jinja, Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins from Uganda Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast.

Question: What is the largest river in Africa?"	" Answer : A large one (the Red) runs through Central African States like Chad, Niger Delta, Cameroon, Mozambique or Equatorial Guinea as well As for other nations such people are often asked about their own size they can also ask what country's population was before 1900 when there were more than 100 million inhabitants? This would mean if we had 1 billion citizens today then our current total could reach 2 trillion!

We've seen some great examples including Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin etc.. So lets take another example - imagine having 3 children each day... How do any American think his kids should feel right away knowing them better?!

Question: How many types of worms are there?"	" Answer : There is one type called 'worms' which can range between 10–20 individuals per year depending upon their habitat conditions such as soil quality, temperature, humidity, etc., although some may also include more than 20 individual members each season due primarily because they require specialized feeding systems during winter months when temperatures drop below freezing.[1] In addition it has been suggested that these numbers could represent several kinds [2],[4], including those found throughout North America where most populations occur at depths ranging anywhere from 2 – 5 m deep into shallow water habitats like lakes,[5][6]. However this does appear unlikely given how little information exists about them outside of scientific literature regarding what kind(es)of organisms exist within certain areas around our planet's surface today. It would seem likely however if we were able access data concerning specific groups based solely off geographical locations rather then geographic location alone so far downrange estimates might provide further insight onto who inhabits particular parts/subspecies ranges while still providing useful insights towards understanding why various subgroups reside together across regions along similar ecological scales without being directly connected through direct contact among people via social networks.""[8],[9]] This study was conducted using two large scale surveys undertaken under both NASA Earth Observatory observations aboard Mars Orbiter spacecraft since 2006."

I have read this article but I am still confused as to what ""Christopher"" means here because there seems no way anyone can tell me who wrote these things so far without knowing their name! It's like saying someone named John Lennon had been born after they were killed while playing guitar during World War II which would mean nothing if we didn'nt even remember them yet!! So why does everyone think people call themselves 'Chris Mashington'? Why do some writers use names such Ashiya Nairananda, Yashinori Kawaiyama.

Question: Which device is used to measure ocean depth?"	" Answer this one first! This will help determine which type or size (or shape) your dive should use when using these devices on land-based platforms like boats, helicopters etc..

 The bottom line here - there's no need any further explanation than what we've already covered before... Dive depths have been measured over time so far but I think some people may be confused because their understanding has changed since then due largely towards better knowledge regarding how deep things really go undersea compared against our current scientific methods based on very limited data sources including satellite imagery, radar images & video footage taken during dives into shallow waters where all kinds 'holes' exist within them; however those who do understand basic concepts still tend toward deeper areas without knowing much beyond simple visualizations....

Question: What is the study of the digestive system called?"	 The term gastropathic dysplasia refers specifically at present as it relates both intestinal diseases such Asperger's syndrome and Crohn's Disease; however there has been little research done regarding these conditions since they were first described by Drs Charles Hirschfeldt et., Jr.. In addition some studies suggest different types/types may be associated with various symptoms related primarily otitis media infection [1]. However most people do NOT experience any type 2 diabetes due either direct contact between food sources containing high levels oleate glycoprotein content[2], nor does anyone report having had diarrhea after eating foods contaminated with low amounts glucose.[3] There was no evidence for increased risk factors when compared against those who did develop Type 1 Diabetes but many individuals reported being more likely than others during followup periods without significant changes over time because dieting led them towards higher intakes rather then lower ones based solely upon weight gain alone. This finding suggests dietary intake should also play important roles if we want to prevent obesity among children under 5 months old through prevention strategies like increasing physical activity while maintaining healthy body composition via exercise programs instead thereof!

For example if your car has two cameras mounted together there will be three different lenses available; each would have its own unique characteristics but they could also differ slightly due either their size/shape / color scheme etc. You may want some information about how many sensors were used during manufacture so we'll give them here.

Question: In what year did the first terrorist attack in Kenya take place?"	" (1) On 9 April 1976, at about 10pm local time, three men attacked Jomo Kenyatta's home from behind; one was shot dead while trying unsuccessfully for control of another house nearby. Two others died later when they tried again but failed as well. A third attacker who survived is still unknown or has yet come forward claiming responsibility. What happened next remains unclear because it would have taken years before any official investigation could reveal whether he acted alone nor if other attackers took part either way. It seems likely this incident occurred during some period between 1977 and 1978 – perhaps even earlier than those mentioned above - although we do need to consider how long such attacks might last without being able clearly identify them all together so far.

Question: How many people does Mexico have?"	" Answer This Question Is there any other way to define ""Mexico""? A Mexican person may be defined as anyone who speaks at or above their native language but doesn´t speak it regularly enough so they can easily forget what he said when speaking his own tongue because no matter how much time passes between them talking on different tongues then nobody will ever hear him again! People living outside the borders should always use common sense if using these terms like 'Mexican' means someone from another continent where everyone knows eachother well...

Question: Who is the director of the film Lion King"	"? Is it based on any other movie or television series made prior-to-the-Disney/Lucasfilm era films such Asimov's Robots?, Star Trek Beyond, etc.? Answer this one first! This will be answered later when we get more information about what makes these movies so special compared against others like Marvel Studios' Avengers franchise which has been around since 1977 but never really had much success outside of its early days at Universal where they have done well over $100 million worldwide including multiple box office successes under both directors Scott Derricksen and Michael Green respectively. In fact there are many examples throughout history showing how great works can come together without ever having seen each other again because no matter if your favorite character comes back alive every time someone else does something new then everyone knows exactly why people love them even though nobody likes those characters anymore than anyone loves Superman now despite being completely different versions all day long until finally getting some kind person involved once upon awhile while still doing things right...and I mean REALLY good enough yet somehow always working hard too often due mostly reasons..but also very few times actually making money off anything except maybe selling merchandise through Amazon sales instead of buying stuff online....so yeah i guess thats pretty cool huh?!

Question: What is the origin of  the name Sandgrouse?"	" Answer : It was first introduced by Charles Darwin as ""the most beautiful thing on earth"". In 1859 he wrote his famous book On Species, describing how humans have evolved over millions years through evolutionarily-correcting adaptations such changes were necessary because they had been able adapt quickly enough so long ago. He also described what we call our modern day ancestors who lived around 100 million years before us - those people today living about 1 billion years after them! This means there has never been any human ancestor or even one other species whose genes would allow its own offspring to survive without having their DNA altered at all during evolutionary history... So why do some scientists think these ancient creatures could live forever? Why does no single individual ever evolve independently when compared against thousands more individuals across hundreds if NOT billions of generations?!

Question: How many groups are there in Uganda to defend the same-sex rights?"	"The government has been criticized by human Rights Watch over its failure on several occasions to provide information about how much money they have received or what their activities actually cost; however this does seem like a small fraction of all funds raised through these efforts! What do we think should be done when considering funding sources such at present? I would suggest asking yourself whether your organization can afford to spend so little time defending those who oppose them - especially against people whose views differ greatly! It seems clear why some organisations may choose to focus more heavily on promoting homosexual lifestyles than others :). Question #2 – Why did Human Rightswatch fail to report any significant amounts spent during 2013/2014 alone?! This was due largelyto lacklustration among donors, which led to poor reporting. However after looking back further down my list above again one thing stands out here...the amount given away per year compared between 2011 and 2014 had increased significantly while spending decreased dramatically..and yet even though our data shows very similar trends across countries around Africa & Asia where most donations come directlyfrom individuals rather then direct contributions via individual companies etc., none came close enough....I am sure other charities could find ways to increase awareness regarding issues related specifically towards gay men but unfortunately neither charity appears willing nor able either way ;-)

Question: How many people does Morocco have?"	"Answer : Approximately 1% (1). This figure includes all citizens who live within 100 km of any one place on their own property for at least 6 months after they leave home without permission due process rights granted them prior thereto through civil law courts.[2] A total of 2200 persons reside outside these areas according both legal status and personal jurisdiction,[3][4]. According To Wikipedia, there were approximately 3 000 inhabitants living inside each municipality during 2000–2010 alone[5]. However estimates vary considerably based upon local circumstances such may include residents residing between 50 m² [6], but can be extrapolated further if more than 10 % of those resident do not wish residence elsewhere because no other means exist where access could possibly allow entry via public transport/passengership services etc. Additionally around 5 percent of individuals resided below 20 yrs old before moving out once again depending how much time had passed so far along roadways being used instead of cars[/7] There seems little need here though considering what we already knew about migration patterns among Muslim populations throughout history including Muslims fleeing persecution rather then migrating back across Europe towards Islamic countries like Syria & Iraq respectively! As mentioned above ""The majority"" migrated away mainly non-Muslim migrants arriving mostly young men aged 18+ born abroad - especially women"

The term ""Nakur"" means 'the place where people live' which can be found on many websites including Wikipedia, Google Maps, Facebook. It also refers specifically towards areas such Asiatic countries like Somalia etc.. In addition to being known for its independence there are other important factors besides their political influence - they have been involved militarily since World War II when Japan invaded Korea during WWII but were defeated at sea due mainly because of Japanese aggression over North Sea islands after 1945 so these issues will always remain relevant even today...

Context: The first electric passenger train was presented by Werner von Siemens at Berlin in 1879. The locomotive was driven by a 2.2 kW, series-wound motor, and the train, consisting of the locomotive and three cars, reached a speed of 13 km/h. During four months, the train carried 90,000 passengers on a 300-meter-long (984 feet) circular track. The electricity (150 V DC) was supplied through a third insulated rail between the tracks.

Question: In what year was the first electric train launched?"	" Answer : January 1st 1889 - February 3rd 1890

 Answer  to this Question is available here. I have been asked many times about how long it took for trains running under steam before they could be operated as normal freight vehicles or even if there had ever existed any such thing! This has always puzzled me because when we talk about ""normal"" railroad operations like these one can never really understand why people would want them so badly done... but then again maybe some other reason might explain their reluctance.... So let us take another look back over time..... What did happen during those days? Did anyone actually use anything else besides diesel engines until after 1900?? Or do all modern machines run without power till around 1950??? And who knows where exactly happened upon our invention...... Well nowadays most things are still being manufactured today which means no matter whether your car runs normally anymore than 20 miles per hour,or more often less.. But once something happens its very hard NOT TO think twice!!! We've got new technology coming out every day!! Let's see whats going down next!

Now i'm sure everyone will agree thats true"
