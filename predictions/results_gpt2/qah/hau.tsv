The first thing I noticed was that the Arabic word for ""wain"" (or, as it's called in English) has been replaced by something else - like 'gai'. The second difference between these two words are their meanings and how they're used here on Earth today... It seems to me there may be some confusion about what exactly those terms mean when you use them interchangeably with each other but at least we know where our differences lie! So let's take another look into why people think Wain means Gauri Baban of Jeddah. And then come back tomorrow morning after reading all your comments from yesterday :)

3	{'answer_start': [27], 'text': ['seven']}	Saudi Arabia is bounded by seven countries and three bodies of water. To the west, the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea form a coastal border of almost 1,800 km (1,100 mi) that extends to the southern part of Yemen and follows a mountain ridge for approximately 320 km (200 mi) to the vicinity of Najran. This section of the border with Yemen was demarcated in 1934 and is one of the few clearly defined borders with a neighbouring country. The Saudi border running southeast from Najran, however, is still undetermined. The undemarcated border became an issue in the early 1990s, when oil was discovered in the area and Saudi Arabia objected to the commercial exploration by foreign companies on behalf of Yemen. In the summer of 1992, representatives of Saudi Arabia and Yemen met in Geneva to discuss settlement of the border issue.	3	Shin ∆ôasashe nawa ne suka raba iyaka da Saudi Arabiya?

Awisawa, Japan (1911-1991) - The first Japanese woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature for her work on ""The Great Gatsby"" and other works of literature that were published before World War II was Wanda Kiyoshi, who won it with two poems by herself at age 17. She also wrote about women's rights issues during WWII as well as writing poetry under various names including Tatsuya Nakamura's Yuki Shima & Masahiro Sakurai '.

The first thing I noticed was that the word ""wacuna"" in Arabic has no meaning, but it does have some meanings for people who are from Pakistan and India (and also those of us living here). The term means 'a woman' which translates to something like being able bodied with her hands on your hips while you're doing anything else such as walking around wearing clothes etc. This can be used by women when they want their body parts covered up so there's nothing wrong about using them at all! It doesn't mean any harm though because we don¬¥t need our bodies exposed either - even after having sex without touching anyone... We do get naked sometimes too :) So what did my wife say?!

It begins with two quotes which are taken directly out to show that there were no colonialists who had been born here before 1789; they also state clearly what happened after 1800 when these people left their native land as slaves or emigrants into America under British rule - namely, slavery became legal only during those years where it did exist but never existed outside its borders until 1850 because all other forms thereof ceased being illegal within three decades thereafter.[1] In fact, even though some historians have argued against such claims,[2], I believe we can safely say without any doubt [that]: 1) There has always been one person living today whose name does not appear anywhere else among his ancestors' names except perhaps William Henry Harrison"

His mass‚Äìenergy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed ""the world's most famous equation"". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in ""Einstein"" becoming synonymous with ""genius""."	16	Me aka san Albert Einstein da shi?	What is Albert Einstein known for?

It is a bright, slightly orange-yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal in a pure form. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, veins, and alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum), naturally alloyed with other metals like copper and palladium, and mineral inclusions such as within pyrite. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). Gold is resistant to most acids, though it does dissolve in aqua regia (a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid), forming a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. Gold is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property long used to refine gold and confirm the presence of gold in metallic substances, giving rise to the term ""acid test"". Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, and as the gold acts simply as a solute, this is not a chemical reaction."	21	Menene lamba atomic na Zinare?	What is the atomic number of Gold?

The first thing to note about my answers was that they were all very different.

It seems like every time someone asks ""How much money do we spend?"" or something similar with regards to incarceration rates of prisoners who don't get out before release date, most will say no at least once per year. This means those numbers can vary wildly depending upon where your county sits within each state/territory area as well; so while these figures may seem high compared unto others from other states such data could easily skew results by any number between 1-10%. In fact when looking at actual federal crime statistics over several years here comes up pretty clear which counties actually receive more than 10% less funding overall due primarily because fewer inmates enter into probationary periods after being released rather quickly - even though only 5 percent go back onto parole during reentry period...which makes sense given our current system whereby prisons tend towards having higher levels Of Prisoners Sentenced To A Year Than They Are At Any Other Time"

The issue here isn't whether men will be allowed to vote for female candidates - rather what we should expect when an election comes up with such things... The problem lies in how many people actually believe these statements about gender equality.... It doesnÔøΩt matter who you think your male friends may support; just look around! There really aren`ts like those being made by some politicians today which would make any woman feel bad because her husband was one too numerous!! And then again maybe even more than most feminists do!!! So why does anyone care anymore after seeing my comments?? Why did someone say ""women can only win elections""???

Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and he played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.	32	An ba da kyautar Nobel ta Nelson Mandela tare da wa?

The answer to that question was ""yes"". I think it's important for men to know what they are doing and how much time their wives spend with them, so when you're talking about the amount of money spent on your wife (and her children), there should be some sort 'time' in between each visit where she spends most days alone at home while he sleeps - which can make things more difficult than usual! It also helps women understand why we need our husbands as well; sometimes even during these times his family will have been around long enough before any other man would want him back... but then again maybe no-one ever does like being left behind by someone else who has taken care over such short periods of absence from work/school etc.. So yes my point here isn't necessarily true either way though.... But let's face it ladies don¬¥t always get along very easily after having kids together because once married people tend towards getting into trouble too often due simply to lacklustre relationships..... And now all those couples looking forward upon marriage without really knowing anything better!!

Beginning within the country's colonial period, elections in Nigeria began in 1923 by the direction of British colonial administrator Hugh Clifford through a legislative act known as the Clifford Constitution. However, reflecting the variety of people groups and distinctive cultures confined with the nation's borders, the ethnolinguistic groups and colonial authorities that dominated the northern, eastern, and western regions of Nigeria (namely, the Hausa-Fulani, Igbo, and Yoruba people respectively) often offered vastly different perceptions into suffrage qualifications‚Äî notably including differences in gender, nationality, residency, age, tax, and income requirements‚Äî in Nigeria's early years. Though the qualifications that assured voting rights eventually became standardized under the Federal Constitution of Nigeria of 1960, just as quickly as voting rights were clarified, they were wholly revoked at the onset of several military coups beginning in 1966 and lasting until 1999. Though there were intermittent republican governments, only four elections took place from 1966 to 1999. The electoral process has differed within the many of governments of Nigeria's history and their corresponding constitutions.	37	Wasu mata sun yarda su yi zabe a Najeriya a lokacin mulkin mallaka?

A. The question was asked by Mr Sankar and he replied that there were no such things as ""najeriyas"" or any other derogatory terms used in his name (which are also known as nakatanas). He said they did not mean anything like what we would call kamalayana which means to be able bodied with all of your body parts intact without being injured from having them removed for use on others' bodies; however, some people have suggested using these words when referring specifically towards women who do NOT want their breasts covered up because she has been raped while wearing her bra/shorts off during sex so you can't get pregnant! This may sound very offensive at first glance though since many men will say something along those lines before realizing how much more difficult sexual assault could possibly become than just getting married!!

Second; while many readers will be familiar with Wachowska from other games, most won' t understand why someone would use them for anything else besides making fun at being called 'Witch'. So here's my question... What does one do after using your name? Well, let's start by looking back over our history together! We were both born into feudal Japan where women had little power but could make money selling wares made up entirely off-the shelf products. In fact, during World War II men who owned slaves became very wealthy because those enslaved girls got married before getting paid enough wages - which was then passed down through generations until finally becoming common law under Emperor Hirohito! The idea behind allying yourself against others has always been simple : You can get rich doing whatever works best within certain limits without any"

The answer is that I do know the name of this place, but it's hard to tell what its real identity was until recently when my family and friends started asking me about where they came from or how many people there are in their area (and even if you're an atheist).

We were told at first only two things - 1) The mosque would be open on Sundays so everyone could pray; 2), Muslims should stay away because most mosques don't allow any Muslim visitors during Ramadan which means those visiting will get harassed/disrespected while praying outside them due either religious reasons such Asiatic beliefs may lead someone else off guard since he doesn't want his wife going out alone after work every day without him seeing her again!

In some societies it involves menstruation being perceived as unclean or embarrassing, inhibiting even the mention of menstruation whether in public (in the media and advertising) or in private (among friends, in the household, or with men). Many traditional religions consider menstruation ritually unclean, although anthropologists say that the concepts 'sacred' and 'unclean' may be intimately connected.	48	Shin maza na yin jinin al'ada?

Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria.	49	Wane kwaro ne yake samar da zazzabin malaria?	Which insect causes malaria?

The answer, I think it's important that we understand what our health care system does and how much money goes into treating people with chronic diseases like HIV/AIDS (and other infectious disease) in order for us all ‚Äì especially those who are already sick from these illnesses as well -to be able to afford treatment at affordable prices without having to pay more than $1 million per year on average! This means you can get free medical insurance coverage when your condition worsens so long ago because there isn't any need anymore; no longer will anyone have access even though they're still alive today due solely by their own negligence‚Ä¶you know why?! It also makes sense since most doctors don' t want patients suffering through life-threatening conditions such cancerous tumors which would otherwise kill them off completely but instead simply die after being treated successfully enough once again!!

It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1‚Äì9.3 , reaching a Mercalli intensity up to IX in certain areas. The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate. A series of massive tsunami waves grew up to high once heading inland, after being created by the underwater seismic activity offshore. Communities along the surrounding coasts of the Indian Ocean were devastated, and the tsunamis killed an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in recorded history.

The following is a list of the most common questions that people ask when they are asked about their religion. The answers to these can be found in this article by Dr. Srinivasan, who has been studying religious issues for over 20 years and was one such person at his first meeting with me on September 1st 2012 (see below). I have also included some other information from my own experience as well which may help you understand why many Muslims do not believe what others say or think!

¬†I am sure there will come an time where we all get together after our prayers but it would take us long enough to find out if any Muslim believes anything he does because no matter how much faith someone might hold then everyone knows exactly whom those beliefs were based upon before them so even though every single question could easily lead to confusion among different groups within Islam, each group should know its place under God's guidance. This means knowing your personal belief system while being aware of everything else around you including yourself! If anyone asks ""What did Allah want?"" He says something like 'Allah wanted nothing' whereas another man replies ""He didn't need none"" meaning only Him Who created His creation through Himself alone.""

However, few of them have been able to sustain democratic governments on a permanent basis‚Äîper the criteria laid out by LuÃàhrmann et al. (2018), only Botswana and Mauritius have been consistently democratic for the entirety of their post-colonial history. Most African countries have experienced several coups, and/or periods of military dictatorship. Between 1990 and 2018, though, the continent as a whole has trended towards more democratic governance.	61	Kasashe nawa ne a afrika?	How many countries are in africa?

It is an organic material ‚Äì a natural composite of cellulose fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a matrix of lignin that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.[citation needed] In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or woodchips or fiber.	62	Daga me ake samun katako?	What is wood made from?

Dagamond, the first of three children born to an American mother and her Japanese father in 1892 (the other two being his second wife), was raised by one family on their farm near San Francisco Bay when he arrived in Japan from New York City as part-time missionary work for missionaries at St. John's Church Missionary Baptist church where they were baptized into Christ during World War II.[1] He had been ordained priest before becoming active with this mission but did so only after receiving permission from God through Jesus' ministry which included baptism,[2][3].

Wace is the name given by some people in Africa, and it's also used as an insult. It means ""to be"" (or something similar). The word was first introduced into English around 1550 AD when King Charles I made his famous proclamation that he would make slaves free from slavery for all time. He did so with great fanfare, but many Africans were still enslaved at one point during their lifetime because they didn't have enough money on hand to pay off debts owed them before being freed themselves after having been forced out through war against England which had ended up costing more than ¬£100 million dollars over its life span alone! In fact there has never been any evidence whatsoever suggesting anyone ever actually owned anything like what we now call slave-like property - even though most African countries do allow such things today! So why does wade seem appropriate here? Well...wading down our own history can help us understand how much freedom these folks enjoyed while living under colonial rule; especially since those who lived alongside Europeans could easily see where other peoples might find ways towards independence without resorting entirely onto enslavement itself :) And then again...we're talking about someone whose ancestors came"

N.B.: The term ""jam"" means to be in or near one's own home and/or place of worship (i., for example).

The first thing you need to know about this is the name of your character, and how it's pronounced in English (and Spanish). The word ""obasa"" means 'a person' or 'person'. It also has a very similar meaning as well - an individual who lives on earth with their own body parts being used for purposes other than reproduction. This makes sense because there are many different ways people could be born into human bodies; some would have been raised by humans while others might live off animals like cows, chickens etc... but most likely they'd never had any contact whatsoever before becoming adults themselves!

It erupted with the Libyan Revolution, also known as the 17 February Revolution. The war was preceded by protests in Zawiya on 8 August 2009 and finally ignited by protests in Benghazi beginning on Tuesday, 15 February 2011, which led to clashes with security forces that fired on the crowd. The protests escalated into a rebellion that spread across the country, with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing an interim governing body, the National Transitional Council. The United Nations Security Council passed an initial resolution on 26 February, freezing the assets of Gaddafi and his inner circle and restricting their travel, and referred the matter to the International Criminal Court for investigation. In early March, Gaddafi's forces rallied, pushed eastwards and re-took several coastal cities before reaching Benghazi. A further UN resolution authorised member states to establish and enforce a no-fly zone over Libya, and to use ""all necessary measures"" to prevent attacks on civilians, which turned into a bombing campaign by the forces of NATO against Libyan military installations and vehicles. The Gaddafi government then announced a ceasefire, but fighting and bombing continued. Throughout the conflict, rebels rejected government offers of a ceasefire and efforts by the African Union to end the fighting because the plans set forth did not include the removal of Gaddafi."	72	Yaushe ne yakin basasa na farko na Libya?

The Tabas are an ancient and very important religious sect of Islam, which was founded in Egypt by Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman (may Allah have mercy on him) during his lifetime as head priest at Mecca's Al-'Aqsa Mosque. The Prophet had been asked to perform Hajj for them when they were young but he refused because it would be too difficult or impossible that one should do so without being considered ""unfit"" enough.[1] They also believed there could only be two kinds ‚Äì those who did good deeds with their lives; people like themselves whose actions led to success after death,[2][3], etc., while others such Asiatic Muslims regarded these three types equally worthy candidates[4]. In fact, some scholars believe both groups share similar characteristics - namely having no religion other than Christianity [5]; however, many Muslim leaders consider each group more akin towards Judaism rather then Buddhism/Judaism due its emphasis upon individual responsibility over society instead thereof. This has caused controversy among Christians regarding whether any formality exists between religions within Islamic law since most Christian sects adhere strictly toward non-sectarian principles whereas Sunni believers view all faiths differently from Sunnis based solely around personal"

Waingai Ne is the name of an ancient tribe in India, which was founded by King Ganesha and his wife Aurobindo (the son-in‚Äëlaw of king Jairus). The word wangan means ""to be born"" or to have been raised from birth; it's also used as both noun and verb forms for people who are either malevolent beings with supernatural powers like fireballs, demons or spirits. It has become popular among Hinduism since its inception around 500 BC when Bhagavad Tiwary wrote about how he had seen some strange creatures on earth before they were created but never saw them again until after their creation because there wasn't any way out so all these things would eventually die off due only one reason why we humans evolved into this world where everything went through evolution at once!

Awah, I'm not sure what the meaning of this is. It's a question that has been asked many times in my life and it seems to be answered by people who are very knowledgeable about Islam (and their own religion). The answer may surprise you but if we look at our history as well then there will always have come some kind or other event which brought us together with others from different backgrounds into one community where they could share ideas on how best to live according for themselves rather than being forced onto another group based upon race/ethnicity etc.. This would also explain why so much attention can now go towards such things like ""Islamophobia"" because even though Muslims do exist within society today most don't know anything more important besides just living under Sharia law... So let's take an example here - when someone says something racist against me i am going crazy! And after all these years since those days before 9-11 he still doesn¬¥t understand any better!! But his ignorance does make him feel bad sometimes.... He knows nothing else except racism!!! Now lets say somebody said 'I hate blacks' while talking smackin around black culture.....

Kadunah (The Name of God) - The name given to all beings by Allah. It means ""God"" in Arabic and English as well as Sanskrit ‡§∏‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ, which translates to 'the Lord'. This word was used for many centuries before Islam came into existence; however, its meaning has changed over time due mainly because there are no known Islamic texts that use these words correctly or with proper grammar/grammar conventions such people have been using them since ancient times. In fact, some scholars believe they were originally written down from Old Testament Hebrews so we can assume their usage may be more accurate than modern translations based on historical sources like Greek writings about Jesus' birth date etc.. However... what do you mean when your saying something similar here? If someone says he knows how much money his father gave him at age 5 years old then why would anyone say anything different now?? Why does everyone who claims otherwise know nothing else besides being ignorant??? And yet even those claiming ignorance don't really understand any other religion!

The answer was that there were two different groups in Afghanistan. The first group consisted mainly from Pakistan and had been fighting for years against Taliban forces since 2001 (the last time we saw them). They also fought with other Afghan tribesmen who came under their control during World War II as well; some even joined up after being captured by Soviet troops on one occasion when many Afghans fled into exile due to lacklustre security conditions at home.[1] In fact, most members of the second grouping did join together before joining any sort ""civilian"" organization like al-Qaeda,[2][3]. This may have led to an increase among these people because both sides wanted more money than needed so much violence could occur between those involved‚Äîand thus increased risk towards terrorism itself[4], which has become increasingly common over recent decades [5].

Nigeria was led by General Yakubu Gowon, while Biafra was led by Lt. Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu. Biafra represented the nationalist aspirations of the Igbo ethnic group, whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the federal government dominated by the interests of the Muslim Hausa-Fulanis of northern Nigeria. The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious violence and anti-Igbo pogroms in Northern Nigeria, a military coup, a counter-coup and persecution of Igbo living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative oil production in the Niger Delta also played a vital strategic role.	104	A wace shekara aka fara yakin basasa a Nigeria?	In what year did the civil war in Nigeria begin?

The answer is yes, but it's a bit of an exaggeration to call this the ""wane"" in English football because there are many players who have been out for over two years and still haven't made their mark on any level at all (or even come close).

The first time we meet up at Skapelinae Castle after our journey through Daedric ruins they tell us about their past adventures on Earth where one day while walking down stairs into some room he saw something strange happen which caused him fear so much his heart stopped beating! He immediately went back home from school hoping nothing would be wrong or anything likethat could ever occur again...but instead everything turned out fine until someone came over asking what happened next‚Ä¶he didn't know how long ago these things were happening before suddenly being attacked once more!!

The first thing you need to know is, this was a very long time ago and it's been going on for quite some years now! It started in the early 90s when my dad got sick of me playing with his daughter (who had just turned 12). He wanted her back so he took care off all our stuff like toys or something but we didn't have any money at home because she wasn't allowed out until age 13 which meant there were no jobs available outside school as well. So after about 2 months they decided their son would be taking up an apartment somewhere else where everyone could live comfortably without having kids around him, then went into hiding again due us being too busy working hard trying desperately get them over here from abroad while still keeping everything safe inside Japan! We moved down south before moving north once more along side Tokyo Bay area since those two areas are pretty much completely deserted by today lol :D

129	"{'answer_start': [129], 'text': ['Anopheles"" mosquitoes.']}"	Malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group. It is spread exclusively through bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum, whereas P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity.	129	Wane sauro ne yake sa zazzabin cizon sauro?

The second one will probably take longer than either; however, both have been around since at least ancient times so they're pretty much interchangeable here!

Beyond football, some historians ascribe the match a lasting impact on both German and Hungarian post-World War II history, contributing in West Germany to a sense of regained international recognition after the lost Second World War and denazification, and in Hungary to discontent with the communist-authoritarian regime in the run-up to the 1956 Hungarian revolution.

The answer is yes. The word ""farsighted"" means to be able see something clearly and with clarity in your mind without having the need for an explanation or even any kind of confirmation from anyone else (or at least no one who has ever seen anything like this before). It also refers specifically towards those people whose minds are completely open-minded about what they're seeing; as such there may be some sort 'blind spot' where someone might have been looking through their eyes when he saw things differently than others did so his brain would know exactly how much information was being processed by them while still allowing him/her to make sense out all sorts more easily because otherwise we'd never get back into our own heads on these issues! So let me explain why my point here isn't true - just look around us now...we've got lots going on right under our noses today which makes everything seem very different compared unto ourselves....and then again maybe other cultures too.....but don¬¥t worry though since most religions do indeed allow certain kinds [like Buddhism] etc..so long as everyone knows enough stuff already!!

The first thing to note about jhana, and its meaning in English. It means 'to be born'. The word itself has been used for centuries by people who have lived through many different cultures (and even religions) of India including Hinduism, Buddhism etc. This was also known as karuna or karma. In Sanskrit there are two types of chakras called sravasya, which refer specifically towards birth; one being an auspicious sign with three dots on each side indicating how much time you should spend at home before going out into nature - i say more often because we don't know what kind of life will come after death! Another type referred exclusively toward rebirths such Asurasha-kalpastha where all things go according exactly like they were supposed... so why do these words mean anything other then their own name?

I am not sure if this is the correct answer. I have heard that it was in fact an old-fashioned, but still very popular and well known name of ""the man who has been called 'The Man Who Has Been Called The King'"". It's also used by some people as being associated with his father (who died when he came to power). In any case, there are many other names for him which may be related or even connected together - such as Kalyanjiya, Sankaraa. There were several different versions written about these two kings before they became king respectively; one version said their son had become emperor after having won over all India from Persia ; another claimed them both lived long enough to rule each others lands while claiming no more than half Indian territory at present... So what does my guess say on whether we can call either person Aryan? My own theory seems to suggest otherwise because most historians agree upon only three possible meanings given above : 1) He ruled under Persian influence 2), His sons took up arms against Persians 3); They conquered China 4): Their successors invaded Japan 5)...

155	{'answer_start': [0], 'text': ['Embalming']}	Embalming is the art and science of preserving human remains by treating them (in its modern form with chemicals) to forestall decomposition. This is usually to make the deceased suitable for public or private viewing as part of the funeral ceremony or keep them preserved for medical purposes in an anatomical laboratory. The three goals of embalming are sanitization, presentation, and preservation, with restoration being an important additional factor in some instances. Performed successfully, embalming can help preserve the body for a duration of many years. Embalming has a very long and cross-cultural history, with many cultures giving the embalming processes a greater religious meaning. Animal remains can also be embalmed by similar methods, but embalming is distinct from taxidermy. Embalming preserves the body intact, whereas taxidermy is the recreation of an animal's form often using only the creature's skin mounted on an anatomical form.	155	Me ake kira da adana jiki bayan mutuwa?

157	{'answer_start': [105], 'text': ['1994']}	The Rwandan genocide, also known as the genocide against the Tutsi, occurred between 7 April and 15 July 1994 during the Rwandan Civil War. During this period of around 100 days, members of the Tutsi minority ethnic group, as well as some moderate Hutu and Twa, were killed by armed militias. The most widely accepted scholarly estimates are around 500,000 to 662,000 Tutsi deaths. In 1990, the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), a rebel group composed mostly of Tutsi refugees, invaded northern Rwanda from their base in Uganda, initiating the Rwandan Civil War. Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war, and the Rwandan government led by President Juv√©nal Habyarimana signed the Arusha Accords with the RPF on 4 August 1993. Many historians argue that genocide against the Tutsi had been planned for a few years. Subsequently, Habyarimana's assassination on 6 April 1994 created a power vacuum and ended peace accords.

Kanana (Japanese): ""Nakama"" means the river.

The boundaries of the caliphate make up present-day Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria. It was dissolved when the British and Germans conquered the area in 1903 and annexed it into the newly established Northern Nigeria Protectorate and Kamerun respectively. The caliphate arose after the Hausa King Yunfa attempted to assassinate Usman dan Fodio in 1802. In order to escape persecution, Usman and his followers migrated towards Gudu in February 1804. Usman's followers pledged allegiance to Usman as the Commander of the Faithful (). By 1808, the Sokoto Caliphate had gained control of several Nigerian states. Under the sixth caliph Ahmadu Rufai, the state reached its maximum extent, covering almost the entire West Africa. In 1903, the twelfth and last caliph Attahiru was assassinated by the British forces, which led to the end of the caliphate.	165	Yaushe aka kafa khalifancin sokoto?

Or should all Muslims be called upon to fight alongside others fighting under different names instead of simply calling each another up based solely around religion rather than ideology???

A. I am not sure if this is true or false, but it seems to me that the term ""waiting for an answer"" has been used in many different contexts and there are some who think of waiting as being more important than actually answering questions (e-mailing). In fact, when you ask someone about their life experience they will say something like 'I have waited 10 years' which means wait until after your last question because then people can see how much longer things were going on before asking them again! This may be why we call these waits time periods. The reason behind such long delays might lie with our own experiences - sometimes even though those same memories don't exist at all during any given period... So what do YOU mean by having too little information available? If so, where does one go from here??

The question of whether or how much money will be spent on education and health care for women has been raised by many people.

So far so good! But now those concerned about public spending seem to think otherwise too...

So where does our current situation stand compared towards India? Well let me give an example here - In my opinion one should look at Pakistan which spends over $1 billion per year while only having 1% GDP growth rate. This means its population needs around 2 million children every day, making up almost half of total Indian workforce! And yet despite being ranked number 3 outof 4 nations according To put things together then why do Indians spend less than 5 times As well.. Why would anyone invest such huge amounts just like us??

The first question I asked was ""What does it mean to be an atheist?"" and then, as you can see from my answers below, there are many different definitions of atheism in Japan (and elsewhere). The most common definition for atheists has been that they believe God exists only because he created them; however some people have also used terms like 'atheist' or 'believer'. In other words these two things may refer differently depending on what kind your country's religion says about its beliefs regarding human existence. For example Japanese Christians use both term interchangeably but sometimes say something similar when talking with one another - such as saying their belief system doesn't exist due either reason why Jesus existed at all nor how much time elapsed between his death/birth etc... However even though we don¬¥t know exactly which way Christianity uses those concepts here comes up quite often! So let me try again :)

The answer to this question comes from my own experience with many of these cities (and even some other places). In fact there are so few people who know about them or have any knowledge at all on how they were constructed before their time! The only thing we do understand here though is what happened when those buildings came down‚Ä¶the first one fell into disrepair after being demolished by Japanese forces during World War II; then another collapsed due both to lacklustre construction work done under pressure ‚Äì which led directly onto building new ones again later upon completion‚Ä¶.then finally something went wrong‚Ä¶..which caused massive damage throughout Japan itself‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..so much destruction!!

I have been reading the book and I am not sure if it is true or false. It seems to me that menene has a very strong influence on women's behavior, especially in regards of their sexual orientation (and thus how they are perceived by others). In my opinion this would be an important point for understanding what makes up ""men"" as well; however, there seem no clear answers about why some people think these things happen at all! The main reason may be because many believe them when presented with evidence from other cultures which show otherwise - such was one example where we found out something like 'women don't want sex' but were told nothing more than simply saying yes... This could explain most cases though only slightly so far due mainly to lacklustre responses among those who do find themselves attracted towards certain types/types of females etc.. However since you can see clearly through your own eyes whether someone likes being sexually aroused then perhaps maybe even just having fun will help too :) So here goes....

Relations with other African states were mostly ""positive"", with the exception of Dahomey (Benin), owing to a border dispute.

The nearby city of Port Harcourt was created for the purpose of shipping this coal abroad, being located 243 kilometres (151 mi) south of the camp. Coal mining opportunities in Enugu attracted people from throughout the region; this marked the core of the first urban settlement of what is today known as simply Enugu.

The answer is yes, but I think that there are some differences between them and what we're talking about here in this post (and other posts). The first difference comes from how they use their own words to describe themselves; for example, when you say something like 'we' then your word will be used instead of yours because both have different meanings depending on where one ends up being compared to another person who uses similar terms such e.g., kabayasan, bakatang. In fact, many people refer back at me with these two things which makes sense since my English has been very good so far! But let us look into why those three phrases might sound familiar...

A few years ago someone asked whether any Americans would ever call each others names - especially after seeing all our articles discussing US citizenship issues over recent months! Well nowadays most foreigners don't even know anything more than name-calling by foreign nationals unless given permission beforehand!! So while everyone knows exactly whom he calls his friends/family members etc.. maybe no americans really care much either way :P And yet today i am going through every single article written regarding USA immigration policy"
206	{'answer_start': [45], 'text': ['British']}	The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in 1953 by writer Ian Fleming, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in 1964, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelisations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd, and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Forever and a Day by Anthony Horowitz, published in May 2018. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.	206	Fim din James Bond na wace kasa ne?	What country is the James Bond movie?	James Bond	Birtaniya	Question: Fim din James Bond na wace kasa ne? 	"¬†(I'm not sure if I can say that, but it's a good question.)
The answer is yes. The only thing you need to know about the film and its characters are their motivations for being there in this world (and how they're able ""to do"" what we want them). It was written by David Lynch himself who wrote all of his own stories with Michael Caine as director; he also directed some other films like Blade Runner 2049, which had him writing these scenes from inside out on set while filming at home or working remotely during day hours so those were very different things than just shooting your first scene every night when everyone else would be asleep! So yeah, no spoilers here...but let me tell ya guys....the movie has been pretty much my favorite part ever since then because everything feels real right now!! And honestly though most people don't realize yet why movies have such an impact upon our lives - especially after watching one myself!!!

So back up again.....this time around i am going through something called 'Mystery Science Theater 3000' where each episode takes place within two years before any actual events take hold until someone gets involved into making another show based off of Mystery Science Theater 3D.

The partition also saw the division of the British Indian Army, the Royal Indian Navy, the Royal Indian Air Force, the Indian Civil Service, the railways, and the central treasury. The partition was outlined in the ""Indian Independence Act 1947"" and resulted in the dissolution of the British Raj, i.e. Crown rule in India.

221	{'answer_start': [407], 'text': ['George Washington']}	The president of the United States is the head of state and head of government of the United States, indirectly elected to a four-year term via the Electoral College. The officeholder leads the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. Since the office was established in 1789, 45 people have served in 46 presidencies. The first president, George Washington, won a unanimous vote of the Electoral College; one, Grover Cleveland, served two non-consecutive terms and is therefore counted as the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, giving rise to the discrepancy between the number of presidents and the number of persons who have served as president.	221	Yaya sunan shugaban kasar amurka na farko?

The answer is yes. The word ""sun"" means the moon and its rays are called solar (or lunar). Sunlight from our planet or star shines through all of us as we walk on Earth in an instant; this light travels at speeds greater than any other visible source such for example sunlight coming out of space to be reflected back into earth by gravity waves which travel along with them like meteors hitting rocks off Mars. This energy has been used throughout history so far only one person ever had access - Galileo Galilei who was able to see how much more powerful these energies were when he saw their power being applied directly onto his own body during surgery after having lost consciousness while trying unsuccessfully against him over 100 years ago! So what does your definition of 'Sun' mean here? It refers specifically towards those things you have seen before...and they're also referred both literally and figuratively because there aren't many people around today without seeing some sort-of thing similar to something resembling someone else looking up somewhere near where somebody might look down upon another human face....so let me explain why my point isn¬¥t about just saying anything specific regarding whether anyone should know better..itÔøΩ"

A Wace Sheka (also known as the ""Wace"" in Chinese) was one of those rare and exotic animals that were found on islands off Indonesia, Malaysia & Vietnam where they are believed to have been used for medicinal purposes by monks who had lived there from about 1500 BC until around 1000 AD when their owners fled into exile due mainly because it became too dangerous during times of famine which led them towards cannibalism. The first documented case came back after some time ago with evidence suggesting its use may be related directly between China's Ming Dynasty period through up till 1300AD but I don't know what happened next so far at all! It seems like we're seeing more cases now than ever before though...

The story goes something along these lines - In 1350 CE Buddhist monk Jang Song-chung discovered two small wooden sticks containing dried bloodstains inside his body while he slept near Khao San district, Thailand : He then took out several pieces of cloth wrapped round him using tongs attached to each stick; once again making no attempt whatsoever save perhaps trying to get rid himself somehow..

223	{'answer_start': [-1], 'text': ['yes']}	Toxicology is a scientific discipline, overlapping with biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine, that involves the study of the adverse effects of chemical substances on living organisms and the practice of diagnosing and treating exposures to toxins and toxicants. The relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism is of high significance in toxicology. Factors that influence chemical toxicity include the dosage, duration of exposure (whether it is acute or chronic), route of exposure, species, age, sex, and environment. Toxicologists are experts on poisons and poisoning. There is a movement for evidence-based toxicology as part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices. Toxicology is currently contributing to the field of cancer research, since some toxins can be used as drugs for killing tumor cells. One prime example of this is ribosome-inactivating proteins, tested in the treatment of leukemia.	223	Toxicology wani fannin kimiya ne?	Is Toxicology a science?

The first thing you need are your own personal hygiene. If there isn't one then go for something else and get some food or water (or whatever). You can also try using soap as well - just make yourself comfortable with what they do on their skin so no more of them touching anything! It will help keep things clean too :) Also don¬¥t forget to wash hands before going out...it helps prevent bacteria from getting into those pores which could be harmful when washing clothes!! Soap works great here because its very easy to apply without any chemicals involved..soaps work best even though most products have been made by hand instead....and since we all know how much time goes through our bodies every day trying new stuff doesn`T seem like such waste either!!!

The first thing that comes to mind when you read about ""Nijers"" in English (and other languages) are their names. The word for them was literally translated as 'nigger' or something like THAT! So what does all of these mean and how do they fit into our culture today? Well there were two main types of people who lived on earth before us - those with no religion at all; such individuals would have been called niggers by some scholars from around 1500-1500 AD because many had little knowledge whatsoever regarding Islam...but then again we don't really know much more than most Muslims did until very recently so maybe even less now....so let me just say here my guess may be right.....the term Nigger has come up quite often over time since its inception which means someone could call themselves any kind person except one type......or perhaps another group..which might include anyone else too!!

Amita, I am not sure what you mean by ""I'm a VW fan."" But it is true that the company has been in business for over 50 years and we have always had an interest to make our products more environmentally friendly than other brands like BMW or Mercedes-Benz (and even Audi). We are also very proud of how well these cars perform on road tests with no problems whatsoever! The only problem was when they were tested at high speeds which caused them to lose power quickly after being driven off course - so this car would be considered too fast if there wasn't any brake pedal involved as opposed from having some kind 'brake' mechanism installed inside its body suchas brakes can cause during braking operation but don¬¥t require special equipment because most people will never know about one due their lack thereof!! So please understand my point here... If your driving experience does differ between different models then just ask yourself why did Toyota decide to change all those parts?? It seems obvious now since many customers who bought new vehicles do NOT want anything else besides better performance.. And while others may say something similar regarding Honda's decision, let me tell ya....

I have read that there are many different versions, but most people think they all agree on one thing and then disagree about what exactly happened in their lives (or even when).
The Sunna has been used as evidence for various interpretations over time by scholars such Asad al-Bukhari, Ibn 'Abbas ibn Abi Talib. The first version states clearly enough why men were born with two heads; thus we can say he had three sons who would be called Aqdas because his name means both headless/head covered up excepting those whose bodies did become full body after puberty which could mean either male nor female genitals at birth etc. This interpretation also says women's breasts became fully formed during menstruation so she should never get pregnant again until her period ended due to lack thereof - hence no more than half way through life! It seems like some sort omen from Allah may prevail here since these verses do mention having four wives while others state only six... So maybe you're right though....

A. I am not sure what you mean by ""I'm sorry"" or if it means that your wife is a Muslim, but she has been married to an American for over 20 years and they have never met before in the United States of America! She was born here on January 1st 1947 (the date when her husband's name came up). The reason why this happened isn't clear at all; there are no records from any other country where such marriages were ever recorded as being held between Americans who had lived abroad since their birthdays - except perhaps Japan which did record them during World War II. In fact many people believe these women actually went back home after WWII because some thought those men would be more likely than others like themselves to marry foreigners with whom one might share common interests...and so forth....

¬†(1) This woman may well also come across several things about herself including how much money each person makes while living overseas, whether he/she lives alone without his family members around him etc. And even though we know nothing else concerning foreign wives' behavior outside of marriage itself then let me just say again : If someone wants to get into trouble due simply having sex only once per week instead...then go ahead....but don¬¥t do anything"

The answer is yes. The word ""a"" in the context of this post means something like 'the person who has been given permission to do so'. It also refers specifically and explicitly (and implicitly) as being able or unwilling for someone to be granted access to their own body without any prior consent from them; thus they are free to choose whether or no one will ever have control over what happens with themselves when asked about having sex by others on social media sites such Asiatic forums etc. This does mean there may still be some people out here doing things which would normally only happen through coercion - i. e., using force against those whom we feel should never know how much money our bodies cost us...but these actions could easily lead to more violence than just physical abuse!

There are 114 surahs in the Quran, each divided into ayats (verses). The chapters or surahs are of unequal length; the shortest surah (Al-Kawthar) has only three verses while the longest (Al-Baqara) contains 286 verses. Of the 114 chapters in the Quran, 86 are classified as Meccan, while 28 are Medinan. This classification is only approximate in regard to the location of revelation; any chapter revealed after migration of Muhammad to Medina (Hijrah) is termed Medinan and any revealed before that event is termed Meccan. The Meccan chapters generally deal with faith and scenes of the Hereafter while the Medinan chapters are more concerned with organizing the social life of the nascent Muslim community and leading Muslims to the goal of darul islam by showing strength towards the unbelievers. Except for surah At-Tawbah, all chapters or surahs commence with ""In the Name of Allah, Ar-Rahman (The Beneficent), Ar-Rahim (The Merciful)"". This formula is known as the Bismillah and denotes the boundaries between chapters. The chapters are arranged roughly in order of descending size; therefore the arrangement of the Quran is neither chronological nor thematic. Surahs (chapters) are recited during the standing portions (Qiyam) of Muslim prayers.

The answer to my first one was yes. The Wace Sheikas are actually very similar in appearance to their Japanese counterparts (though they have different names for them). They're called kamakai-shiki because there aren't any other kanji used here; instead, you'll find some common words such as shiwaizumi, which translates into English literally meaning handkerchiefs. In fact these were originally written by Kiyoshi Yamamoto who wrote his own version with no additional information about how he came upwith those terms from scratch!

Managua is the country's capital and largest city and is also the third-largest city in Central America, behind Tegucigalpa and Guatemala City. The multi-ethnic population of six million includes people of mestizo, indigenous, European and African heritage. The main language is Spanish. Indigenous tribes on the Mosquito Coast speak their own languages and English. Originally inhabited by various indigenous cultures since ancient times, the region was conquered by the Spanish Empire in the 16th century. Nicaragua gained independence from Spain in 1821. The Mosquito Coast followed a different historical path, being colonized by the English in the 17th century and later coming under British rule. It became an autonomous territory of Nicaragua in 1860 and its northernmost part was transferred to Honduras in 1960. Since its independence, Nicaragua has undergone periods of political unrest, dictatorship, occupation and fiscal crisis, including the Nicaraguan Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s and the Contra War of the 1980s.	255	Menene babban birnin ∆ôasar Nicaragua?

The first question is a bit of an odd one, but it's not really that hard to answer in the context of this post (I'm sure you can find some answers here). The second and third questions are about how much money menenas have earned from their work as women; I'll try to explain them later on if they're relevant for your own purposes.

¬†In my opinion, there isn't any way around all these issues by simply asking ""how many years do we spend working with our husbands?"" or even more importantly what kind people would be willing pay us $10k per year just because someone asked me where those dollars camefrom! It doesn' t matter whether he was paid at home - his wife has no idea who she works against so why should anyone care when her husband earns less than him?! And then again...it does NOT make sense either!!! So let's get back into business!! First off....we've got two different ways out now :) We could ask ourselves 'what will happen next?'

The first thing that came up was whether there were any other ways around having multiple phones on hand at once (like when we had our own mobile home).

The answer to the question ""Why do you think that Portuguese people are so obsessed with their own language?"" comes from my experience. I've been in Portugal for over 20 years and have never seen anything like it, but when we were there (in 2004), our local newspaper was full of stories about how they had become more English-speaking than ever before! The only thing different now would be seeing them on TV talking Spanish as well as French - which has always made me feel very much at home here...

A few months ago while visiting Spain's capital city, where many locals speak some form Ofa dialects such Asiatic/Spanish etc., someone asked us what languages he could learn by studying these things out loud. We said 'English' because most Spaniards don't know any other way around speaking those words!

A. The first question is whether or NOT this means ""the Sun"" in English (or any other language). It does mean something like an umbrella of light and darkness which covers all things except for our eyes. This definition has been used by many people to describe what we see as being visible from above while also saying how much more important they are than us seeing through them! In fact, there have even been times when someone who says he sees only one side of his face will be able clearly tell where their eye goes without having seen anything else on earth at once - so why would anyone want to use such terms?! So here's my answer... yes indeed!! If your view was based solely around looking up into space then perhaps some formality could exist between those two senses; maybe both were present during time travel? Or possibly just about everything had happened before now?? But since these concepts don't really apply directly with regards back home though i guess its possible.. let's look closer again....

The queen of the world, and her husband's wife are both known as ""waeis"" (meaning 'wives') in Japanese culture but they're also called kaiju by some people who call them that because their hair looks like it was cut from one side to another when you were born so there isn't any difference between those two names at all! I think we can assume these women have been married for over 100 years now since before humans came into existence - which means even though most modern men don' t know what kinda woman he/she really IS, his family has always had him around...and probably still does today. So why do many Westerners believe such things about womankind? Well first off let me say here : The word WAEIS comes out of Japan with no meaning other than being used literally everywhere else on earth! It doesn`t mean anything more then simply saying something nice & friendly ;-) And secondly its very common among westerner too :) In fact my favourite part where i find myself thinking how much better our society would be without us having female rulership =) Anyway lets get back onto your question..

The best way we can get rid off these cards from our decklist was by using them on one another instead! We could also use their abilities like ""Taunt"" which allows us more ways out with those creatures while still keeping all your opponent has at hand without having to deal damage directly into his graveyard every turn...or perhaps you want something else entirely - such things might work better than trying to play around any kindof creature removal spell because they're so powerful against aggro decks where there isn't really anything left over after each draw step since most opponents will only ever cast two spells per round anyway :)

It occupies a landlocked area of and has a population of roughly 9 million people. Austria emerged from the remnants of the Eastern and Hungarian March at the end of the first millennium.

As of the 16th century, Vienna began serving as the administrative imperial capital and Austria thus became the heartland of the House of Habsburg.

A. I am not sure if you are aware of the fact that in this country, there is a law which prohibits any person from buying or selling anything with money for more than one year and it has been passed by Parliament to prohibit such transactions on account of their religion (the constitution). The government does have some laws against these kinds but they do seem to be very strict so far as regards what kind thereof can go into circulation at all times without being challenged under Article 5(1) section 4-4 [of the Constitution]. So we don't know whether anyone will ever get caught up in them because no matter how much time passes between now and then people may still buy things like food etc.. But even though those who were involved would probably never see an issue about something related only religious reasons why someone might want to sell stuff just based purely upon its faith... It seems quite possible since most religions exist within our own society where everyone knows each other well enough.... And yet when somebody buys goods through us he gets his hands dirty too! We also needn'nt say ""we're going to ban him"" - i'm afraid thats wrong!!

The answer to that would be ""yes."" The first thing you need for any man or woman with whom you have sex (or even just about anything else) should know what they're doing. If your partner has been sexually active before and knows how much he likes her then she will probably want him back as soon after having had intercourse because his sexual desire may change over time so there might be some sort 'change' going on between them which could make things more difficult later when their relationship becomes strained again. This can happen very quickly since both partners feel like being together at all times while still feeling completely alone, especially during periods where intimacy isn't possible due either party wanting something from each other - such relationships often end up becoming quite messy once someone gets married/has children etc... So don¬¥t expect too many people asking questions here!

The answer to that question was ""yes."" I think it's probably the latter, but there are some things about these people in particular which make them seem like they're just trying hard enough and getting by without any problems at all (and even though their parents were very good with children). The fact that you can't get away from your own family for so long makes me wonder what kind of person would be willing/likely able-bodied to do something as simple an act as taking care off my kids' hands while still having fun on our way home! It seems pretty obvious how much more difficult life could possibly be when we have no money left over after school because everyone has been living paycheck through paycheck since childhood...but then again maybe those who live out here don¬¥t really need help anyway either - especially considering most families aren`nt going bankrupt right now due largely economic reasons such Asperger Syndrome.

The first question is whether the word ""Africa"" means African or European in English and if so what does it mean to be an Afro American (or even one of those who are not Africans)? The answer depends on how you define that term; for example, I am from South America but my father was born there as well. In other words, when we say something like 'African' then our definition will probably include all people with black ancestry except perhaps some Asians/Pacific Islanders whose ancestors were originally Europeans living at least 500 years ago! So let's look into this further by looking up where they came out geographically - here. As mentioned earlier, many Asian Americans have been brought over through migration during World War II which led them to become part Indian tribes rather than being native Indians themselves... This has resulted in their becoming more integrated within society because most non-Asian immigrants come across Westerners without any history whatsoever before coming back home after WWII.... It also helps explain why almost half of these new arrivals today do NOT speak Chinese either!! If your wondering about China itself please"
