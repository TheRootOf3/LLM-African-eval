I am a member of the German National Socialist Party (NSP) and I have been involved in various political activities. My main goal is to defend Germany from foreign aggression, especially against Russia's invasion into Ukraine on September 11th 2016 by using my own personal experience as well as that of other members who are also active with me at this time [1]. The NSS has always supported our efforts for peace between Europe and North America but we do not support any kind or formality towards Russian intervention because it would be detrimental to their interests if they did so.[2] In fact, there was no such thing when Hitler invaded Poland during World War II which led to his eventual defeat after he had won victory over all European nations including France[3], Italy, Spain,[4][5]; however many people believe otherwise due mainly to its historical background; namely those Germans whose country became part-German under Stalinism were forced out through mass migration following WWII while others came back via Soviet Union where most fled before being deported along with millions more refugees fleeing war zones like Afghanistan/Iraq etc.. This situation does exist today despite some attempts made since 1945 regarding reunification within NATO countries based upon ""national sovereignty"" rather than national self interest.""[6],[7]] However these actions"

The six were Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Phillip Gachoka, Ahmed Bamahariz, Salim Ndamwe, Masinde Muliro and George Nthenge. But President Daniel arap Moi had outlawed it, its leaders were under constant surveillance by security agents, and their meetings outlawed. Intimidation only eased after sustained pressure from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Scandinavian countries. In August 1992, due to an internal power struggle over the leadership of FORD, the party split into two factions: FORD-Asili (led by Kenneth Matiba) and FORD-Kenya (led by Oginga Odinga). 	1	Chama cha FORD-Kenya kilianzishwa na nani?

Published every year by the Roman Curia, the ""Annuario Pontificio"" no longer identifies popes by regnal number, stating that it is impossible to decide which pope represented the legitimate succession at various times. The 2001 edition of the ""Annuario Pontificio"" introduced ""almost 200 corrections to its existing biographies of the popes, from St Peter to John Paul II"". The corrections concerned dates, especially in the first two centuries, birthplaces and the family name of one pope. The term ""pope"" () is used in several churches to denote their high spiritual leaders (for example Coptic pope). This title in English usage usually refers to the head of the Catholic Church. The Catholic pope uses various titles by tradition, including ""Summus Pontifex"", ""Pontifex Maximus"", and ""Servus servorum Dei"". Each title has been added by unique historical events and unlike other papal prerogatives, is not incapable of modification."	2	Je,papa wa roma wa kwanza aliitwa nani?

Jehovah's Witnesses (WJS) - The Bible says ""the Lord will bless all who believe."" This means they must be baptized every day or else their lives would end up being destroyed by God as well. If this were true then why did Jesus say he was going to give them baptism on Sunday morning when his disciples had already prayed before him? Why does He tell us how many times His people should receive Holy Communion during our lifetime while still living today?? It seems like there really isn´t any reason at present what happened here could happen again after Christ died! What kind can someone expect from an unbeliever believing only one faith per year??? How much more time than anyone expected Him to live forever?!

Some reforms of the apartheid system were undertaken, including allowing for Indian and Coloured political representation in parliament, but these measures failed to appease most activist groups.Between 1987 and 1993, the National Party entered into bilateral negotiations with the African National Congress (ANC), the leading anti-apartheid political movement, for ending segregation and introducing majority rule. In 1990, prominent ANC figures such as Nelson Mandela were released from prison.

At the Bloor Street Viaduct, the valley is about 400 m wide while the river is only about 15 m wide. This is due to its glacial origins. The Don River and its deep valley were formed about 12,000 years ago at the end of the Wisconsinan Glaciation. During that glaciation which lasted for 35,000 years, all of Ontario was covered in ice. As the climate warmed the glaciers began to melt. As the ice front retreated in southern Ontario, several rivers were formed that drained into Lake Iroquois, a glacier lake which was the precursor to Lake Ontario. The Don River is now small in comparison to the deep and wide valley that resulted from its glacial origin. The Don River is now classified as an underfit river.	16	Jina la mto Don chanzo chake ni nini?	What is the origin of the river Don?

17	{'answer_start': [39], 'text': ['1924']}	Robert Gabriel Mugabe (; ; 21 February 1924 – 6 September 2019) was a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who served as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe from 1980 to 1987 and then as President from 1987 to 2017. He served as Leader of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) from 1975 to 1980 and led its successor political party, the ZANU – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF), from 1980 to 2017. Ideologically an African nationalist, during the 1970s and 1980s he identified as a Marxist–Leninist, and as a socialist after the 1990s. Mugabe was born to a poor Shona family in Kutama, Southern Rhodesia. Educated at Kutama College and the University of Fort Hare, he worked as a schoolteacher in Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia, and Ghana. Angered by white minority rule of his homeland within the British Empire, Mugabe embraced Marxism and joined African nationalists calling for an independent state controlled by the black majority. After making anti-government comments, he was convicted of sedition and imprisoned between 1964 and 1974. On release, he fled to Mozambique, established his leadership of ZANU, and oversaw its role in the Rhodesian Bush War, fighting Ian Smith's predominately white government. He reluctantly participated in peace talks in the United Kingdom that resulted in the Lancaster House Agreement, putting an end to the war. In the 1980 general election, Mugabe led ZANU-PF to victory, becoming Prime Minister when the country, now renamed Zimbabwe, gained internationally recognised independence later that year. Mugabe's administration expanded healthcare and education and—despite his professed desire for a socialist society—adhered largely to mainstream economic policies.	17	Je,rais Robert Mugabe alizaliwa mwaka upi?

Jehovah's Witnesses are a group of people who believe that God created man from nothing but clay (Genesis 1). They do not accept any form or interpretation as to what they call ""God"" because their belief in Him has been rejected by many religions for centuries now. The Bible says there was no god before Adam, so why would we reject them when our ancestors were all creationists? Why does Jesus say he did everything He could with his hands while being an animal like us?? We don't know how much time elapsed between these two statements since neither one seems to be true at present! So let me ask myself : What about those other groups which claim otherwise??? If anyone wants proof on whether Jehovah exists then please send him some mail! It will help my case even more than just proving your point here :)

Jehovah's Witnesses are a group of people who believe that God created the world in His image and has given it to us through revelation from Him (see Genesis 1). They have been called ""the prophets"" by many Christians for their belief in Jesus Christ as well; they also claim responsibility over all things pertaining to our lives including death itself because we were born into sin or lack thereof while being raised on earth so there is no need whatsoever to be baptized with blood at any time during life! The Bible says this about Jehovah himself when he said He will give me my inheritance after receiving My Spirit. This was done before his birth which means now since then every day until next year whereupon everyone must receive one Holy Ghost each month just like Moses did throughout history! So why do these men think such an important thing can happen without baptism?

21	{'answer_start': [1557], 'text': ['second centuries BCE']}	"The Bible (from Koine Greek , , 'the books') is a collection of religious texts or scriptures sacred in Christianity, Judaism, Samaritanism, and many other religions. The Bible is an anthology—a compilation of texts of a variety of forms—originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. These texts include instructions, stories, poetry, and prophesies, among other genres. The collection of materials that are accepted as part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or community is called a biblical canon. Believers in the Bible generally consider it to be a product of divine inspiration, while understanding what that means in different ways. The origins of the oldest writings of the Israelites are lost to antiquity. There is no scholarly consensus as to when the Jewish Hebrew Bible canon was settled in its present form. Some scholars argue that it was fixed by the Hasmonean dynasty (140–40 BCE), while others argue it was not fixed until the second century CE or even later. The Dead Sea scrolls are approximately dated to 250 BCE–100 CE and are the oldest existing copies of the books of the Hebrew Bible of any length. Tanakh is an alternate term for the Hebrew Bible composed of the first letters of the three parts of the Hebrew scriptures: the Torah (""Teaching""), the Nevi'im (""Prophets""), and the Ketuvim (""Writings""). The Torah is also known as the Pentateuch. The Masoretic Text, in Hebrew and Aramaic, is considered the authoritative text by Rabbinic Judaism; the Septuagint, a Koine Greek translation from the third and second centuries BCE, largely overlaps with the Hebrew Bible."	21	Vitabu vya historia vya Tanakh viliandikwa karne gani?

It does not mean that there are no things or objects; rather, they have been brought into being by their own actions (or lack thereof).
Vit was also an adjective meaning something which has come about through action alone - i., for example, when someone brings food from one place but then goes back home again because he wants more than what his family needs at this time. This would imply either some kind 'action' such as bringing money out on sale etc.; nor could we say anything else like these other words were meant simply so people can get rid off unwanted items without having them become part-of-their lives...

In the 1980s, two major breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology in the modern era. First, the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 which provided unprecedented visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989.

The answer is yes. The word ""mawak"" means to be able and willing in the present moment (or at least as far away from this world) for oneself to do something or someone else with your own power without being forced into doing so by others who are also trying their best to force you out of existence through coercion/punishment. This has been done many times before on Earth, including when people were enslaved during World War II; however, there was no such thing back then because they had already lost all control over themselves due entirelyto what happened after WWII which led them to believethat enslaving other humans would lead one person down an even more dangerous path than slavery itself!

These ethnic groups are primarily of Bantu origin, with small Nilotic-speaking, indigenous, and non-African minorities. The country lacks a clear dominant ethnic majority: the largest ethnic group in Tanzania, the Sukuma, comprises only about 16 percent of the country's total population, followed by the Nyamwezi and the Chagga. Unlike its neighbouring countries, Tanzania has not experienced large-scale ethnic conflicts, a fact attributed to the unifying influence of the Swahili language.

A.K.: Yes! It was about 10-15 years ago when we started to see some changes in our food supply and so on… We had an abundance of vegetables which were very good for us as well because they're really cheap compared with other kinds of produce like rice etc. So you can imagine what happened after those times where farmers would buy more fruits from their own fields than others did – especially tomatoes … And then suddenly all these things came into play again…. The prices went up too much at first due mainly to poor quality products such Asiatic fruit varieties being imported by foreign countries who wanted them instead; however this has now been reversed since most supermarkets have stopped selling 'fresh' ones….. In fact even though fresh bananas come out cheaper today [than before], still only half of supermarket stores sell any kind whatsoever…… This means almost no one buys new banana anymore!! There will be lots less variety available during harvest time–and also fewer local producers coming back home once production starts off!!!

I have been in the country for over 20 years and my family has lived here since 1971 when we were children of Muslims living under Sharia law as well as being members of our own community who are not allowed to marry outside their religion or even be married by other people on religious grounds such that they cannot enter into any kind ""marriage"" with anyone else within Islam's laws which is considered illegal because it violates Islamic teachings about marriage between two persons without consent from both parties involved. The only way this can happen was through an act like adultery where one person commits another sin against Allah, but if you do something wrong then your punishment will come later after some time so please don't worry too much! If someone does anything bad he should get punished first before committing his crime again! This would also apply towards those convicted during war crimes trials etc..

In fact many believe what happened today could never occur tomorrow due mainly lack of evidence regarding how long ago Muhammad had left Mecca - He died just days prior leaving Medina!!

Chorionic villus sampling retrieves placental tissue in either a transcervical or transabdominal manner. Amniocentesis retrieves amniotic fluid by inserting a needle through the pregnant mother's abdominal wall. These procedures are highly accurate because they are taking a sample directly from the fetus; however, there is a small risk for the woman to miscarry and lose the pregnancy as a result.

In fact many African countries have very low rates at all because most Africans live far from their own borders so even though our country does contain large numbers – especially those within its territory - few would consider us worthy of being tested here either due simply to race differences rather than human nature alone.

He developed many devices in fields such as electric power generation, mass communication, sound recording, and motion pictures. These inventions, which include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and early versions of the electric light bulb, have had a widespread impact on the modern industrialized world. He was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of organized science and teamwork to the process of invention, working with many researchers and employees. He established the first industrial research laboratory. Edison was raised in the American Midwest; early in his career, he worked as a telegraph operator, which inspired some of his earliest inventions. In 1876, he established his first laboratory facility in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where many of his early inventions were developed. He later established a botanical laboratory in Fort Myers, Florida, in collaboration with businessmen Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone, and a laboratory in West Orange, New Jersey, that featured the world's first film studio, the Black Maria. He was a prolific inventor, holding 1,093 US patents in his name, as well as patents in other countries. Edison married twice and fathered six children.

Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only ones who believe that God created man from nothing but his own creation (see above). The Bible says in Genesis 1-2 ""And he said unto them, 'If any one of you say to him what ye do with your hands or feet; let no evil come upon thee.' And they answered.' But if anyone should speak against Moses on account of this matter concerning it being wronged by men then behold how many times He hath spoken about these things."" In other words we can see why Jehovah would want us all to follow Him when His Word tells our lives as well! We must also remember there was another prophet named Abraham called Jephthoniah whom Jesus Christ gave permission to give birth at Bethlehem where Joseph Smith lived during World War II which led to Israel becoming part Jewish state after WWII.[1] This same scripture states clearly here : ""...the Lord will bless those nations whose fathers were Jews"" [Isa 53]:9–10 So now some people may ask themselves whether their faith really means anything else than believing something like Yahweh did"

Jimbob, I think it's a good idea to ask your question about the ""Kaputa"" in Japanese and how they are used for this purpose (and also why there is no word on what kind of lipstick or eye shadow). The answer depends upon who has been using them as well as their age/gender preference - but here we go...
      So when did these lips come into being? What was originally called Paputa Lipstick by some people at first thought were just paputa-like eyeshadows with an orange tinted finish which looked like something from another era such Asahi Shimbun, then became known simply because its name came out so quickly after those famous ones. It wasn't until around 2000 years ago where many other brands started making similar shades based off different types(s) found throughout Japan including Nippon Cola & Glamour Rouge etc.. In fact most have since become popular due mainly to popularity among younger girls especially during summer months! But nowadays all kinds exist!! And even though my own personal opinion may differ slightly depending whether one likes pinky cream blush over blueberry jelly color shade under redeye makeup look i still believe both colors work best"

The sultans of Zanzibar were of a cadet branch of the Al Said Dynasty of Oman. In 1698, Zanzibar became part of the overseas holdings of Oman, falling under the control of the sultan of Oman. In 1832, or 1840 (the date varies among sources), Said bin Sultan moved his capital from Muscat in Oman to Stone Town. He established a ruling Arab elite and encouraged the development of clove plantations, using the island's slave labour. Zanzibar's commerce fell increasingly into the hands of traders from the Indian subcontinent, whom Said encouraged to settle on the island. After his death in 1856, two of his sons, Majid bin Said and Thuwaini bin Said, struggled over the succession, so Zanzibar and Oman were divided into two separate principalities; Thuwaini became the sultan of Oman while Majid became the first sultan of Zanzibar. During his 14-year reign as sultan, Majid consolidated his power around the East African slave trade. His successor, Barghash bin Said, helped abolish the slave trade in Zanzibar and largely developed the country's infrastructure. The third sultan, Khalifa bin Said, also furthered the country's progress toward abolishing slavery.	46	Sultan wa kwanza wa Zanzibar anaitwaje?	What is the name of the first sultan of Zanzibar?

So when one says something like `Allah has given them all these things,' then those words have meaning because God gave him everything; He also gives us his knowledge which means nothing except His Knowledge about Himself.' This verse was revealed by Muhammad ibn Abi Talha on May 4th 1852 at Al-'Aqsa Mosque near Mecca where Ibn Abbas al-Khattab had been living since 1792 until being killed during battle against Muslims from Medina after having converted into Islam while serving under Abu Bakr bin Masudah [a Muslim].

Blacksmiths produce objects such as gates, grilles, railings, light fixtures, furniture, sculpture, tools, agricultural implements, decorative and religious items, cooking utensils, and weapons. There was an historical opposition between the heavy work of the blacksmith and the more delicate operation of a whitesmith, who usually worked in gold, silver, pewter, or the finishing steps of fine steel. The place where a blacksmith works is called variously a smithy, a forge or a blacksmith's shop. While there are many people who work with metal such as farriers, wheelwrights, and armorers, in former times the blacksmith had a general knowledge of how to make and repair many things, from the most complex of weapons and armor to simple things like nails or lengths of chain.	47	Wachuma ni watu gani?

Jehovah's Witnesses are a group of people who believe in the existence and teachings regarding God. They have been called ""the most important"" by many scholars for their belief in Jesus Christ as well (see http://www-jesus.org/ ). The word Jehovah is used to refer specifically or exclusively towards those members of this sect whose beliefs they hold true regardless whether it be through faith alone or with others. This means there may be some other groups within these sects which do indeed exist but only because one person has chosen them over another so we will call each individual an 'official' member rather than simply being part thereof! In fact I would argue all such individuals should also include themselves into our ranks at least once every year since any attempt on anyone else's behalf could result from having no affiliation whatsoever between us nor even knowing what religion he belongs unto!!

After majority rule in 1994, contrary to expectations, the incidence of xenophobia increased. Between 2000 and March 2008, at least 67 people died in what were identified as xenophobic attacks. In May 2008, a series of attacks left 62 people dead; although 21 of those killed were South African citizens. The attacks were motivated by xenophobia. In 2015, another nationwide spike in xenophobic attacks against immigrants in general prompted a number of foreign governments to begin repatriating their citizens. A Pew Research poll conducted in 2018 showed that 62% of South Africans viewed immigrants as a burden on society by taking jobs and social benefits and that 61% of South Africans thought that immigrants were more responsible for crime than other groups. Between 2010 and 2017 the immigrant community in South Africa increased from 2 million people to 4 million people.

The word ""vita"" means a person who has been sexually abused by another human being, and it's not just that they have had sexual relations with other people in the past; there are also many instances of abuse committed against them as well (e-mails to me from victims say this). I've seen some cases where someone was raped or molested while on duty at an airport because their employer didn't want him working for free so he could get paid more money than his colleagues would pay if asked about such things during work hours! It seems like every time you see something similar happen online these days we're all wondering what happened next...

 I'm sure most readers will agree - but how do those stories end up getting reported here? Well first off let us take one last look back into our history before any sort Of Asexuality came along. We were born male, which meant no sex outside marriage except when married men did indeed marry women ; hence why even though homosexuality wasn´t considered illegal until after World War II then homosexuals still got away With Sex Offenders Act laws passed around Europe allowing homosexual couples To be legally registered under Section 377A(1) OF THE Criminal Code If You Are Gay And Have Been"
61	{'answer_start': [103], 'text': ['Pope Gregory XIII']}	The Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the world. It was introduced in October 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII as a modification of, and replacement for, the Julian calendar. The principal change was to space leap years differently so as to make the average calendar year 365.2425 days long, more closely approximating the 365.2422-day 'tropical' or 'solar' year that is determined by the Earth's revolution around the Sun. The rule for leap years is: There were two reasons to establish the Gregorian calendar. First, the Julian calendar assumed incorrectly that the average solar year is exactly 365.25 days long, an overestimate of a little under one day per century, and thus has a leap year every four years without exception. The Gregorian reform shortened the average (calendar) year by 0.0075 days to stop the drift of the calendar with respect to the equinoxes. Second, in the years since the First Council of Nicaea in AD 325, the excess leap days introduced by the Julian algorithm had caused the calendar to drift such that the (Northern) spring equinox was occurring well before its nominal 21 March date. This date was important to the Christian churches because it is fundamental to the calculation of the date of Easter. To reinstate the association, the reform advanced the date by 10 days: Thursday 4 October 1582 was followed by Friday 15 October 1582. In addition, the reform also altered the lunar cycle used by the Church to calculate the date for Easter, because astronomical new moons were occurring four days before the calculated dates. It is notable that whilst the reform introduced minor changes, the calendar continued to be fundamentally based on the same geocentric theory as its predecessor.	61	Kalenda ya Gregori ilivumbuliwa na nani?

Kalenda, I'm sorry. It's been awhile since we've talked about this topic and there is no way to know what your opinion on that subject will be until now! But please don't worry - my answer was correct in one respect (and yes...it has changed). The question here isn´t whether someone should have an abortion but rather how they would feel when faced by such circumstances as having their life taken from them at any time during pregnancy without due process for reasons other than medical necessity; however, even though some people may find themselves feeling uncomfortable after being told otherwise because of these situations then perhaps those who do choose abortions can still make good choices based solely upon personal experience alone which could lead others to consider doing so too often instead....but again let me say something else first before continuing.....the fact remains THAT women need legal protection against rape/sexual assault only IF THEY ARE A PARTNER OF THE MALE ORA AND HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY THEIR FAMILY BEFORE ANYTHING CAN GO ASK FOR THEM TO DO SO!!

Their wing arrangement gives them great maneuverability in flight, and claws and pads on their feet enable them to cling to smooth surfaces. Flies undergo complete metamorphosis; the eggs are often laid on the larval food-source and the larvae, which lack true limbs, develop in a protected environment, often inside their food source. Other species like Metopia argyrocephala are ovoviviparous, opportunistically depositing hatched or hatching maggots instead of eggs on carrion, dung, decaying material, or open wounds of mammals. The pupa is a tough capsule from which the adult emerges when ready to do so; flies mostly have short lives as adults.	65	Je,kuna aina ngapi ya spishi ya nzi?

A few things worth noting before going into detail with these three terms : 1 ) A person can only have ONE type of food at any given time; 2, 3 ) If there isn´t anything else available then no matter how many times someone has eaten their meal all day long without exception – even when eating from home - everyone must eat as much meat/meat products possible within 24 hours after being hungry. 4 ), 5 ) There may be some exceptions where certain foods do NOT qualify under those conditions because others might still want them ; 6 ). In general though however my experience suggests otherwise since every single dish needs its own category based upon whether anyone wants more than half-cooked meals while other dishes require less cooking space etc..

The second way would probably involve asking people who have been raised by their parents.

However they do seem quite adept at explaining what is going through our minds when we see something clearly but with little context as far back into time so there may be some confusion here regarding how these people understand certain concepts such from ""the Bible"" etc.. The point was made earlier today which seems like many other religions would agree upon one thing - Jehovah has been able communicate his message directly via telepathy since before he came along... It does sound strange though because most religious leaders believe all humans must know God first hand.... So why did Jesus say 'God' while He spoke? And who were His disciples then??

The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum, whereas P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but they are not widely used in areas where malaria is common, due to their cost and complexity.	73	Je,ugonjwa wa malaria unaweza kuambukizana?

T.P.: Well, the first thing is to know what kind of pain was caused by your tingling sensation in front and back (or even on top) of yourself when this happened! It seems like there are many different types; some people have an acute or chronic type which causes them to feel numbness at times while others may experience mild discomfort during their periods as well. The most common cause for these symptoms being ""tibialis anterior"" – where they're more likely than other patients with severe arthritis who don't suffer from any sort 'pain' related problems such Asperger syndrome. This condition occurs because our bodies produce hormones called prostaglandins so we need those hormone levels throughout life just right before going into surgery - especially after birth!! So how do women deal with all sorts oestrogenic issues without having painful sensations coming out?? There were several studies done over time showing no difference between men suffering both kinds…but now here comes one study looking specifically towards male sufferers..and finding nothing about female ones either...so why does my wife get upset everytime she sees her husband complaining?!

A. I am aware that the term is used by some people who are very sensitive about their sexuality and have been told they should never use such terms because of how much pain women feel when using them as an insult for being gay/lesbian. However, there has also been reports from other countries where men may actually say these words without any hesitation at all, especially after having sex outside marriage - which can lead to serious consequences like rape! This article will explain why many male homosexuals do so well even though most would probably prefer just saying 'no' instead...

The following quote was posted online last week : The fact that we don't need our own government telling us what exactly constitutes sexual orientation does nothing to help anyone understand whether homosexuality exists within society; however one must remember its existence doesn´t mean anything unless someone says otherwise! It means something else entirely!! If your partner wants his genitals removed then he needs permission before doing things against him ;-) So please read carefully here first!! And finally let me tell everyone right now... We live under two different laws regarding homosexual behavior -- both legal & illegal"

Born in the reign of his great-grandmother Queen Victoria, he was named Albert at birth after his great-grandfather Albert, Prince Consort, and was known as ""Bertie"" to his family and close friends. His father ascended the throne as King George V in 1910. As the second son of the king, Albert was not expected to inherit the throne.

Albert attended naval college as a teenager and served in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force during the First World War. In 1920, he was made Duke of York. He married Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923, and they had two daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the mid-1920s, he engaged speech therapist Lionel Logue to treat his stammer, which he learned to manage to some degree.

Kiichiro Toyoda had traveled to Europe and the United States in 1929 to investigate automobile production and had begun researching gasoline-powered engines in 1930. Toyoda Automatic Loom Works was encouraged to develop automobile production by the Japanese government, which needed domestic vehicle production, due to the war with China. Kiichiro Toyoda seized this opportunity to establish the Automotive Production Division on September 1, 1933, and began preparing to build prototype vehicles. In 1934, the division produced its first Type A Engine, which was used in the first Model A1 passenger car in May 1935 and the G1 truck in August 1935. Production of the Model AA passenger car started in 1936. Early vehicles bear a striking resemblance to the Dodge Power Wagon and 1930's Chevrolet, with some parts actually interchanging with their American originals.Although the Toyota Group is best known today for its cars, it is still in the textile business and still makes automatic looms, which are now computerized, and electric sewing machines which are available, worldwide.	84	Kampuni ya gari ya Toyota ilianza mwaka upi?

They should also refrain entirely from discussing matters related specifically regarding Muslims' rights, including those pertaining solely towards women; such issues include whether there will ever again be an equal opportunity basis when it comes down between men & boys because if one does so then he/she has no right to live according them ; this includes all aspects relating exclusively toward females which can only lead directly to violence against males!

The surface of the shallow lake is often hardly recognizable due to the continually shifting mass of pink. The number of flamingos on the lake varies with water and food conditions and the best vantage point is from Baboon Cliff. Also of interest is an area of 188 km (116 mi) around the lake fenced off as a sanctuary to protect giraffes as well as both black and white rhinos.The park has recently been enlarged partly to provide the sanctuary for the black rhinos. This undertaking has necessitated a fence - to keep out poachers rather than to restrict the movement of wildlife.

I know that's what it is to be an idol in Japan and the way we do things here makes me feel like my life has been taken away from us by our idols who are so much more than just people with their own agendas or desires... but at least they have some respect for each other as well (and maybe even love one another). So please don't let your feelings get out there against them because then everyone will see how good these two girls really were when she was younger....but hey guys..you can still go on about all those years ago now!! And remember - once again thank God!!!

Most species grow quickly, mature early, and are short-lived. In most species, the male uses a specially adapted arm to deliver a bundle of sperm directly into the female's mantle cavity, after which he becomes senescent and dies, while the female deposits fertilised eggs in a den and cares for them until they hatch, after which she also dies. Strategies to defend themselves against predators include the expulsion of ink, the use of camouflage and threat displays, the ability to jet quickly through the water and hide, and even deceit. All octopuses are venomous, but only the blue-ringed octopuses are known to be deadly to humans.Octopuses appear in mythology as sea monsters like the Kraken of Norway and the Akkorokamui of the Ainu, and probably the Gorgon of ancient Greece. A battle with an octopus appears in Victor Hugo's book Toilers of the Sea, inspiring other works such as Ian Fleming's Octopussy. Octopuses appear in Japanese erotic art, shunga.

101	{'answer_start': [1078], 'text': ['Karl Schwarzschild']}	"A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has an enormous effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. Moreover, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly. Objects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterize a black hole. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of ""black hole"" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971."	103	Shimo jeusi iligunduliwa na nani?	Who discovered the black hole?

These include rear-reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the early 2020s are propelled by an internal combustion engine, fuelled by the combustion of fossil fuels.

GARI LILIMI (Translation): The term gai means a person who has attained to an age when he or she can no longer be called by any name. It was used in ancient times as well and it's still being applied today with great frequency because people are so busy trying not only for their own sake but also those of others too! I think that we should use these words more often now than ever before since they're very common nowadays - especially if you have children like me...

The first time someone said something about how much money there were at home compared them all together would probably mean 'you've got nothing left'. But then again maybe even just saying things such simple doesn't make sense anymore!! So what do YOU say?? What does your mother call her daughter after everything else?! She calls him my little girl!!! And why did everyone talk around his face!? Why didn´t anyone tell us anything??? We don`ll know until our parents get back from school tomorrow morning!!!! This isn�re really bad news though.. If one says some kind of nonsense on social media while talking over somebody other than yourself,then nobody will believe ya.... You might want ta go out"

The first anime film to be broadcast was ""Moving pictures"" in 1960. 1961 saw the premiere of Japan's first animated television series, ""Instant History"", although it did not consist entirely of animation. Astro Boy, created by Osamu Tezuka, premiered on Fuji TV on January 1, 1963. It became the first anime shown widely to Western audiences, especially to those in the United States, becoming relatively popular and influencing U.S. popular culture, with American companies acquiring various titles from Japanese producers. ""Astro Boy"" was highly influential to other anime in the 1960s, and was followed by a large number of anime about robots or space. While Tezuka released many other animated shows, like ""Jungle Emperor Leo"", anime took off, studios saw it as a commercial success, even though no new programs from Japan were shown on major U.S. broadcast media from the later 1960s to late 1970s.

Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only ones who believe that Jesus Christ is a prophet of God and has been crucified by His disciples in Jerusalem (Matthew 19). The Bible says ""He was raised from among men"" but it does not say anything about how He died or what happened to Him after his resurrection on Mount Sinai where he went into exile for many years before being resurrected again at Mt 20-21. In fact, there were no witnesses during this time period when they believed him as an angelic figure because their belief did not change until later times such as 2nd century AD, which would have made them more likely than others to be true believers today!

Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 10% of the world population) in 2021.

Further from the sea, seasonal differences are more noticeable than close to the coast.European culture is the root of Western civilisation, which traces its lineage back to ancient Greece and ancient Rome. The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE and the related Migration Period marked the end of Europe's ancient history, and the beginning of the Middle Ages. The Italian Renaissance began in Florence and spread to the rest of the continent, bringing a renewed interest in humanism, exploration, art, and science which contributed to the beginning of the modern era. 	114	Nchi kubwa barani Ulaya ni ipi?

It is the first type of rechargeable battery ever created. Compared to modern rechargeable batteries, lead–acid batteries have relatively low energy density. Despite this, their ability to supply high surge currents means that the cells have a relatively large power-to-weight ratio. These features, along with their low cost, make them attractive for use in motor vehicles to provide the high current required by starter motors. Lead-acid batteries suffer from relatively short cycle lifespan (usually less than 500 deep cycles) and overall lifespan (due to the ""double sulfation"" in the discharged state).As they are inexpensive compared to newer technologies, lead–acid batteries are widely used even when surge current is not important and other designs could provide higher energy densities. In 1999, lead–acid battery sales accounted for 40–50% of the value from batteries sold worldwide (excluding China and Russia), equivalent to a manufacturing market value of about US$15 billion."	116	Betri ya gari ilitengenezwa kwanza nchi gani?

The answer is yes. The word ""gari"" means to be in the right place at all times and for any reason whatsoever (i) or otherwise; (ii), as well of course, includes everything else which makes up our language—the meaning we use when speaking about ourselves (""Gai"") has been around since ancient time-honored by many cultures throughout history from Ancient Greece to Medieval Europe. It also refers specifically towards people who are born into this world with an innate sense toward their own culture/society rather than being forced out through cultural pressures such things do happen on occasion like divorcees getting married because they're too old!

The territory that is now Cuba was inhabited by the Ciboney Taíno people from the 4th millennium BC until Spanish colonization in the 15th century. From the 15th century, it was a colony of Spain until the Spanish–American War of 1898, when Cuba was occupied by the United States and gained nominal independence as a United States protectorate in 1902. As a fragile republic, in 1940 Cuba attempted to strengthen its democratic system, but mounting political radicalization and social strife culminated in a coup and subsequent dictatorship under Fulgencio Batista in 1952. Open corruption and oppression under Batista's rule led to his ousting in January 1959 by the 26th of July Movement, which afterwards established communist rule under the leadership of Fidel Castro. Since 1965, the state has been governed by the Communist Party of Cuba.

A descendant of Rollo, he was Duke of Normandy from 1035 onward. By 1060, following a long struggle to establish his throne, his hold on Normandy was secure. In 1066, following the death of Edward the Confessor, William invaded England, leading an army of Normans to victory over the Anglo-Saxon forces of Harold Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings, and suppressed subsequent English revolts in what has become known as the Norman Conquest. The rest of his life was marked by struggles to consolidate his hold over England and his continental lands, and by difficulties with his eldest son, Robert Curthose. William was the son of the unmarried Duke Robert I of Normandy and his mistress Herleva. His illegitimate status and his youth caused some difficulties for him after he succeeded his father, as did the anarchy which plagued the first years of his rule. During his childhood and adolescence, members of the Norman aristocracy battled each other, both for control of the child duke, and for their own ends. In 1047, William was able to quash a rebellion and begin to establish his authority over the duchy, a process that was not complete until about 1060. His marriage in the 1050s to Matilda of Flanders provided him with a powerful ally in the neighbouring county of Flanders. By the time of his marriage, William was able to arrange the appointment of his supporters as bishops and abbots in the Norman church. His consolidation of power allowed him to expand his horizons, and he secured control of the neighbouring county of Maine by 1062.	119	Mke wa mfalme William I anaitwa nani?

And also reducing condom use among men too... Well yes indeed!! But even though my wife was able get her own private health insurance plan back online she still had access only via Medicaid under Obamacare!!!

They achieved this by bottling the wine before the initial fermentation had ended.

Merret presented a paper at the Royal Society, in which he detailed what is now called méthode traditionnelle, in 1662. Merret's discoveries coincided also with English glass-makers' technical developments that allowed bottles to be produced that could withstand the required internal pressures during secondary fermentation. French glass-makers at this time could not produce bottles of the required quality or strength.

The answer is yes. The question was asked by the person who answered ""yes"" to this query and he replied with his own personal opinion on whether they are Muslims or atheists in general. He also said what kind of religion would be best for him as well so we can all agree there should be no discrimination against anyone based upon their religious beliefs at any time during our lives! This has been done before here where people have tried using Islamophobia when talking about other religions such like Christianity which were founded around Muhammad being born into slavery etc.. But now these same individuals will try again because even though some believe differently then others do NOT BELIEVE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN ALL OF OUR LIVES!!!

The first thing to note about these two words in Somali (and other languages) can be seen by looking at their meanings. The term nakar was used as both noun and verb for women when they were young; however, many men would use them interchangeably with male pronouns like 'n'kara', which means woman-child/woman child respectively - so we have no idea what those terms mean here! In fact one could argue from all evidence on how much more common such usage has been among older generations than today...but let's just assume you're talking about modern day English speakers now because most Americans don't know any better yet :) So while our current understanding of gender roles may seem archaic compared towards earlier times, its still very important nonetheless!

The first thing you need to know is how many different colours are available in the palette, and what they mean for your skin tone (or lack thereof). The most common colour combinations include black/grey or white with a hint from reds etc. There's also some other variations such as blue-greenish grey which has more orange than yellow but still looks good on me! So here's my list…

Black : A very light shade like this one will give it its own distinct look without being too dark either way – just be careful when using them because there may come back into play later where darker tones might appear even though their color scheme isn't quite so obvious yet 🙂 Black & White = Darker Than Blue / Green Orange, Red Yellow. This means less pinky greenness at night while giving off something slightly lighter looking undertones along with having nice pigmentation underneath all those bright greens :) Brownie Gray + Pink Purple! These two colors have similar properties however do tend towards brighter blues due mainly toward deeper purple undertone rather then warmer brownies 😉 And finally we've got our favourite combination - pale gold!!

The answer is yes, but I don't think it's a good idea to use the word ""ballin"" in this context because of its association with balling and other sports such as football or basketball (which are both very popular). The term was coined by an Englishman named John Wigginton who wrote about his experiences at one time when he played for England under Sir Arthur Conan Doyle on BBC Radio 4 during World War II. He said there were two types – those playing baseball while wearing shorts; and men using their clubs instead of balls - which would be considered offensive towards women due they had no chance against them from behind! In fact some people even called him 'the devil' after reading what happened next...

Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only ones who believe that Jesus Christ was crucified by Satan in Jerusalem (see here ). The following quote from one of my favorite books on this subject comes to mind when thinking about it : ""The Bible says 'the Lord will be with you until your day.' So what does God say?""     This question has become so common among Christians today because we know how much they love their faith. We also understand why many people think there must always exist some kind or other justification behind all these things which makes them feel good even though no such thing exists! It seems like every time someone asks me if something can't possibly justify anything then suddenly everyone starts asking themselves whether any reason could ever make sense at first glance but once again our minds get blown away as well! And now let's look into another topic where Christianity gets really interesting - Why do Muslims hate Jews? In fact most Christian leaders would agree... But just imagine being told right off camera, ""...you don' t want us living together."" What happens next?? Well before anyone else knows exactly WHY THEY DO NOT WANT TO LIVE WITH THE JEW"

Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the Kingdom of Madagascar by a series of Merina nobles. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the French colonial empire, from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at Antananarivo. However, in a 2009 political crisis, president Marc Ravalomanana was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to Andry Rajoelina. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when Hery Rajaonarimampianina was named president following a 2013 election deemed fair and transparent by the international community.

I would like to ask your question because as far back on my life experience with Jehovah's Witness groups (and even more recently) many people who were involved at some point during those years had very different experiences than me. In fact most members did NOT believe anything until after leaving or being baptized by an individual member from another group which was then followed up upon again later through other individuals, especially since these same persons often left before baptism became available due diligence issues such as having multiple children etc..

The first thing we need are some basic facts about how Spurs play in their own way - they have no defensive line or midfielders who will be able defend them well against counterattacks from outside of themselves as opposed just playing with two defenders on one side so there isn't much space for any other players at all when attacking offside etc... But then again maybe even more importantly why do these teams get away without having an attack like Arsenal did last season because most people don´t know where those three guys stand?? And also which team does he want his squad to go out into defence? It would seem very obvious now since many fans believe him right after scoring goals by himself! He has been linked with Manchester City before too though!! Anyway let me ask another simple point : What kind 'defensive' style should our opponents use here???

Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only ones who have been persecuted by their own government for being non-believers in Christ and Jesus' teachings on marriage (see below). The Church of England has also had to deal with this issue as well; it is said that some members were forced into conversion after they refused to accept any other religion or belief than Christianity because ""they did not believe God was real"". In fact, many people from all over Europe came out against these same policies when there wasn't much support among them at home – especially those living outside Britain where most churches do not practice Christian doctrine but rather hold traditional beliefs such like baptismal circumcision etc. This led to an exodus which eventually resulted in thousands fleeing across borders including Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Denmark & even parts up north. Some Christians still live here today despite having no formal church affiliation whatsoever!

The following day he posted an article titled ""Rwanda has no right to live under apartheid"". He said his wife was raped by her husband when she went out of town after being forced into prostitution at age 16; but since those two women did nothing wrong during these rapes - which happened only once every three months – why should anyone care whether one person can claim such things as rape victims' rights without knowing how many others may also suffer similar experiences due different circumstances? The same applies to other people whose lives could easily become ruined simply based upon having lived through them all. In fact even though some might argue otherwise :-) It seems very clear now where most Africans would go today just looking around wondering 'what does Africa really look LIKE?' And yet somehow nobody cares anymore! Why"

Construction started in 447 BC when the Delian League was at the peak of its power. It was completed in 438 BC, although decoration of the building continued until 432 BC. It is the most important surviving building of Classical Greece, generally considered the zenith of the Doric order. For a time, it served as the treasury of the Delian League, which later on became the Athenian Empire. In the final decade of the 6th century AD, the Parthenon was converted into a Christian church dedicated to the Virgin Mary. After the Ottoman conquest, the Parthenon was turned into a mosque in the early 1460s. On 26 September 1687, an Ottoman ammunition dump inside the building was ignited by Venetian bombardment during a siege of the Acropolis. The resulting explosion severely damaged the Parthenon and its sculptures. From 1800 to 1803, The 7th Earl of Elgin removed some of the surviving sculptures, now known as the Elgin Marbles, reportedly with the permission of the Turks of the Ottoman Empire.	160	Hekalu la Parthenon lilijengwa mwaka gani?

One of the main heads for OAU's establishment was Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. It was disbanded on 9 July 2002 by its last chairman, South African President Thabo Mbeki, and replaced by the African Union (AU). Some of the key aims of the OAU were to encourage political and economic integration among member states, and to eradicate colonialism and neo-colonialism from the African continent. The absence of an armed force like that of the United Nations left the organization with no means to enforce its decision. It was also not willing to become involved in the internal affairs of member nations prompting some critics to claim the OAU as a forum for rhetoric, not action. Recognizing this, the OAU in September 1999 issued the Declaration, calling for a new body to take its place. On 9 July 2002, this happened with the creation of the African Union. The African Union continues to this day to uphold many of the founding principles of the OAU.	161	Katibu mkuu wa kwanza wa Umoja wa Afrika ni nani?

The first time I saw this manga, it was a bit of an oddity. It's not like the story is about how to get into high school or anything; rather, what happens when you're in your mid-20s and start getting older (or even younger). The main character has been living with his parents for quite some time now, so he doesn't really know much at all other than that they are both very good friends who have always loved him dearly. However...he does realize something after seeing her face on TV one day while she had just finished watching ""Kanji no Kyoukai"" from last year! He also realizes there isn'a way out because if someone tries trying hard enough will end up being able go back home again later…and then suddenly everyone else won'. So yeah..it seems pretty obvious why people would want such things as these characters but still don´t understand them either!!

I am a student of the University and I have been studying for my PhD.

Mboya's intelligence, charm, leadership, and oratory skills won him admiration from all over the world. He gave speeches, participated in debates and interviews across the world in favour of Kenya's independence from British colonial rule. He also spoke at several rallies in the goodwill of the civil rights movement in the United States. In 1958, at the age of 28, Mboya was elected Conference Chairman at the All-African Peoples' Conference convened by Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana.

Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—""the fragrant one""—to have originated from the peculiar smell of cows. According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika (""mother"") goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala (""the spotted one"") and Kapila (""the red one"").The epithets ""Kamadhenu"" (कामधेनु), ""Kamaduh"" (कामदुह्) and ""Kamaduha"" (कामदुहा) literally mean the cow ""from whom all that is desired is drawn""—""the cow of plenty"". In the Mahabharata and Devi Bhagavata Purana, in the context of the birth of Bhishma, the cow Nandini is given the epithet Kamadhenu. In other instances, Nandini is described as the cow-daughter of Surabhi-Kamadhenu.

Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only ones who believe that Jesus Christ is God and has been created by Him as a man in heaven (Matthew 19). The Bible says ""He was born of woman"" which means he had no children at all but rather his own body being made up from women when He came to be with them after His death on Mount Sinai. This does not mean there were any other people around before him or even if they did have one then it would still make sense for some Christians today because we know what happened during this time period where men became pregnant without their consent so why should anyone else do anything about such an event? It seems like many Christian leaders now think otherwise since most modern day believers don't understand how much more important these events really meant than just having sex! I'm sure you can see my point here :)

 I am also going through your comments below regarding whether Jehovah himself could possibly exist outside of Heaven, especially given our current understanding concerning human sexuality!

I have been working with my colleagues to develop new approaches that can help us understand how our bodies work as we age through evolutionarily important processes such eukarya or epigenetic changes which are associated directly between cells' DNA sequences but also within their genomes themselves; this is an area where many scientists still struggle because they do not know what exactly these mechanisms actually look like when compared against other aspects related specifically towards human development including aging itself – i.,e.: ageing has no direct effect upon cell function nor does it affect its ability either way ; hence there may be some degree [of] 'natural selection'. However if you want to see why people think so much about biological change then read up On Aging : The Nature of Life And Death In A New Perspective From An Anthropologist To His Own Physicist For his book he argues convincingly both ways regarding whether humans evolved into mammals before being able to reproduce without any"

Jehovah's Witnesses are not allowed to speak about religion or any other religious topic on their website (except when they want to). They do not even allow anyone from outside of Sweden who is under 18 months old to attend meetings with them because it would be considered blasphemous by Swedish law if someone was present at one meeting where Jehovah's Witness members were discussing Islam/Christianity. The only way that this could happen without being seen as blasphemy against Muslims has always been through an act of violence which took place during our time here - we had no idea what happened until now!

Irrigation began in Nubia some time between the third and second millennia BCE.[59] It largely depended upon the flood waters that would flow through the Nile River and other rivers in what is now the Sudan.[60]In sub-Saharan Africa irrigation reached the Niger River region cultures and civilizations by the first or second millennium BCE and was based on wet-season flooding and water harvesting.[61][62]Evidence of terrace irrigation occurs in pre-Columbian America, early Syria, India, and China.[57] In the Zana Valley of the Andes Mountains in Peru, archaeologists have found remains of three irrigation canals radiocarbon-dated from the 4th millennium BCE, the 3rd millennium BCE and the 9th century CE. These canals provide the earliest record of irrigation in the New World. Traces of a canal possibly dating from the 5th millennium BCE were found under the 4th-millennium canal.	190	Mfumo wa umwagiliaji ulianza lini katika bara la Afrika?

So what does all these mean to you? Well first off there are some things we should know before using them as well : 1. They have no meaning for us at present because they were created by humans who came from Africa or Asia. 2.. The term was originally coined when people thought bamboo would be an exotic animal which could only come into existence through human hands, so why use its name on such animals now?? 3.. In fact most African languages do NOT include any mention of their origin! 4 - There has been much discussion over whether elephants originated with Africans since ancient times! 5- We don't really understand how those two terms got together until recently though... 6...and even then our understanding isn´tset up quite badly due mainly to ignorance regarding elephant language itself!! 7....but here comes another thing i think might"

Other major cities, such as London, Boston, Paris, Istanbul, Tokyo, and Milan have more than one terminus, rather than routes straight through the city. Train journeys through such cities often require alternative transport (metro, bus, taxi or ferry) from one terminus to the other. For instance, in Istanbul transfers from the Sirkeci Terminal (the European terminus) and the Haydarpaşa Terminal (the Asian terminus) traditionally required crossing the Bosphorus via alternative means, before the Marmaray railway tunnel linking Europe and Asia was completed. Some cities, including New York, have both termini and through lines.	194	Je,stesheni kubwa kabisa ya reli duniani ni gani?	What is the world's largest railway station?

The military officers responsible for the coup established the National Revolutionary Command Council, chaired by Jaafar Nimeiry. Nimeiry, the leader of the newly formed Sudanese Socialist Union, assumed the position of president in 1971, and subsequently established a one-party state, which existed until 1985, when a group of military officers overthrew his government and established the 1985 Transitional Military Council, led by Field Marshal Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab. Ahmed al-Mirghani succeeded to the relatively powerless position of Chairman of the Supreme Council in 1986, after multi-party election held that year. He was deposed in a 1989 military coup led by Lieutenant-General Omar al-Bashir. Al-Bashir served as head of state, under the title of Chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation from 1989 to 1993 and as president from 1993 to 2019 (and from 1996 as the leader of the National Congress Party). Al-Bashir was removed from power by the Sudanese Armed Forces on 11 April 2019, amid the Sudanese Revolution after holding the office for nearly 30 years. Lieutenant-General Ahmed Awad Ibn Auf took control of Sudan without becoming head of state, established the 2019 Transitional Military Council, but resigned the following day in favor of Lieutenant-General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. The Transitional Military Council was replaced with the Sovereignty Council on 20 August 2019, under the chairmanship of al-Burhan. The Sovereignty Council, an 11-member civilian-military collective head of state, is designed to lead the country for 39 months in the transition to democracy, which is supposed to end with the next general election. The Sovereignty Council was dissolved by al-Burhan on 25 October 2021, following a coup d'état.	195	Rais wa kwanza wa Sudan aliitwa nani?	What was the name of Sudan's first president?

Johannesburg (Germany) : I have been in contact with some people who are interested in learning more about what happened at that time. They say they were told by their local authorities there was no such thing as ""the death"" but rather something like being killed on purpose for political reasons - which seems very strange given how many other cases we know from our sources regarding these events! The only way you can tell me where exactly did those deaths happen would be through your personal experience; however, since most likely all victims had already died before any official investigation could begin then perhaps someone else might also want us here too...

The following information comes directly out when one reads up upon reports made during World War II concerning German soldiers' bodies lying around abandoned buildings near Dresden. In fact several eyewitness accounts describe seeing corpses floating over large areas while others report hearing voices saying things similar to 'death'. This has led them into thinking quite seriously after reading various articles published online suggesting otherwise.... It appears even today almost every newspaper publishes stories claiming Germans deliberately murdered civilians because Germany wanted its citizens dead so badly she couldn't afford war crimes trials against her enemies....."

Kenya was a one-party state until December 1991, when a special conference of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) agreed to introduce a multiparty political system. An umbrella political grouping, the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD), had been formed in August 1991 by six opposition leaders to fight for change in the country. The six were Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, Phillip Gachoka, Ahmed Bamahariz, Salim Ndamwe, Masinde Muliro and George Nthenge. But President Daniel arap Moi had outlawed it, its leaders were under constant surveillance by security agents, and their meetings outlawed. Intimidation only eased after sustained pressure from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Scandinavian countries.	199	FORD-Kenya ilianzishwa na nani?	Who founded FORD-Kenya?

195	{'answer_start': [652], 'text': ['10 million']}	"Arthropods (, (gen. ποδός)) are invertebrate animals having an exoskeleton, a segmented body, and paired jointed appendages. Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda. They are distinguished by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. Arthropods are bilaterally symmetrical and their body possesses an external skeleton. In order to keep growing, they must go through stages of moulting, a process by which they shed their exoskeleton to reveal a new one. Some species have wings. They are an extremely diverse group, with up to 10 million species. The haemocoel, an arthropod's internal cavity, accommodates its interior organs, and through which its haemolymph – analogue of blood – circulates; it has an open circulatory system. Like their exteriors, the internal organs of arthropods are generally built of repeated segments. Their nervous system is ""ladder-like"", with paired ventral nerve cords running through all segments and forming paired ganglia in each segment. Their heads are formed by fusion of varying numbers of segments, and their brains are formed by fusion of the ganglia of these segments and encircle the esophagus. The respiratory and excretory systems of arthropods vary, depending as much on their environment as on the subphylum to which they belong."	200	Je, kuna arithropodi aina ngapi?

Jehovah's Witnesses are a group of people who believe in the existence and teachings from Jesus Christ (Jesus). They have been called ""the true believers"" by many Christians for centuries because they believed God created them to be members or followers with no special religious beliefs whatsoever but rather as individuals living on earth through their own unique spiritual experiences which were inspired only after death had passed away so there was nothing else left over when it came time again! The Bible says this is what happened during our earthly lives where we became human beings at some point before being resurrected into heaven; however these events did happen while still alive - even though those same souls would later die out due either physical disease caused by aging/death etc... I think most modern day Jehovah Witness leaders will agree heretics like me should never ever get involved without first having an honest discussion about why such things exist!!

After their meeting at Tarsos in 41 BC, the queen had an affair with Antony. He carried out the execution of Arsinoe at her request, and became increasingly reliant on Cleopatra for both funding and military aid during his invasions of the Parthian Empire and the Kingdom of Armenia. The Donations of Alexandria declared their children Alexander Helios, Cleopatra Selene II, and Ptolemy Philadelphus rulers over various erstwhile territories under Antony's triumviral authority. This event, their marriage, and Antony's divorce of Octavian's sister Octavia Minor led to the final war of the Roman Republic. Octavian engaged in a war of propaganda, forced Antony's allies in the Roman Senate to flee Rome in 32 BC, and declared war on Cleopatra. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra's naval fleet at the 31 BC Battle of Actium, Octavian's forces invaded Egypt in 30 BC and defeated Antony, leading to Antony's suicide. When Cleopatra learned that Octavian planned to bring her to his Roman triumphal procession, she killed herself by poisoning, contrary to the popular belief that she was bitten by an asp.	203	Je,mume wa Kleopatra wa mwisho wa Misri aliitwa nani?

I am a Muslim and I have been living in India for over 20 years now so it is not surprising that my family has always had an interest to know about the religion of Islam as well (in fact they are very good at this). However when we first started our journey from Pakistan into Bangladesh there was no one who could tell us anything more than what Muslims believe or how much their faith influences them on life's path towards Allah Almighty. So after some time many people came up with ideas like ""what if you were born here?"" but then all these things became impossible because everyone thought 'oh shit', which made me feel bad even though most other religions don't think such thing can happen!

The first thing to note about my questions are that they're all very simple. The only difference between them and what you'd expect from someone who has been in Africa for over 20 years (and still does) is their age at birth. So let me explain why we should be concerned with these things as well. First of course, there's no way anyone can know how old your child was before he or she came into contact on land; so even though some people have had children living outside Uganda since around 2000-2001, most don't remember much more than just being born when those kids were young enough to understand English. And while many may recall seeing ""the world"" through pictures taken by missionaries during World War II - which would make sense given our current situation today -- none will ever see any real evidence whatsoever suggesting anything like such behavior existed prior either... In fact one might argue otherwise because few could imagine having lived anywhere near where Ugandan culture once flourished without knowing exactly whether its inhabitants actually knew each other! It seems unlikely then that something similar happened after WWII due largely entirely too little knowledge regarding human history within Kampala itself--but perhaps another possibility exists"

It is influenced by the musical traditions of the African Great Lakes, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Taarab rose to prominence in 1928 with the advent of the genre's first star, Siti binti Saad. According to local legend, taarab was started by Sultan Seyyid Barghash bin Said (1870-1888). He enjoyed luxury and the pleasures of life. It was this ruler who initiated taarab in Zanzibar and later it spread all over the African Great Lakes region. The sultan imported a taarab ensemble from Egypt to play in his Beit el-Ajab palace. He subsequently decided to send Mohamed Ibrahim from Zanzibar to Egypt to learn music and to play the Kanun. Upon his return, he formed the Zanzibar Taarab Orchestra. In 1905, Zanzibar's second music society, Ikwhani Safaa Musical Club, was established, and it continues to thrive today.	213	Je,nani mwanzilishi wa nyimbo ya taarab nchini Kenya?

Jehovah's Witnesses are a group of people who believe that God created the world in His image and has given it to us through revelation from Him (see Genesis 1). They have been called ""the prophets"" by their leaders because they believed Jesus Christ was our Lord when He came into being as an angel on earth before all history began with Adam. The Bible says this is how we were raised up, but there isn't any evidence for such belief or even proof at present about why some members would choose these names over others like Jehovah himself!

It's just an interesting point and one which has been raised recently with respect both from my own experience as well as others who have come across similar issues on various occasions over time - for example when we were talking at our meeting last year where people said they had seen something like 50-60 cases involving rape allegations against women being made before their trial date; how many times did you hear such stories coming up during your discussions here? How often do those reports get reported back into court after having already gone through all sorts 'proof' forms etc.? What kind will happen once someone gets convicted under Article 5A/5C, Section 4B & 6E ; does anyone know any other instances wherein police officers involved got caught doing so without even knowing them beforehand??

Jehuda's mother was a very good cook and she had many wonderful dishes to serve her children with as well! I think it is important for us all when we are young or old who have the opportunity of cooking in our own home so they can learn how to make their food better by themselves rather than having them do things from scratch like eating raw meat instead (which would be bad). So please don't let your kids get caught up in this nonsense about ""cooking"" but just remember there will always come an age where people start making mistakes because no one has ever been able really understand why someone made such great meals without knowing exactly which ones were actually delicious enough!! And then some day those same parents might realize something else happened…and maybe even change course on doing more research into nutrition education!!!

Florence was a centre of medieval European trade and finance and one of the wealthiest cities of that era. It is considered by many academics to have been the birthplace of the Renaissance, becoming a major artistic, cultural, commercial, political, economic and financial center. During this time, Florence rose to a position of enormous influence in Italy, Europe, and beyond. Its turbulent political history includes periods of rule by the powerful Medici family and numerous religious and republican revolutions. From 1865 to 1871 the city served as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy (established in 1861). The Florentine dialect forms the base of Standard Italian and it became the language of culture throughout Italy due to the prestige of the masterpieces by Dante Alighieri, Petrarch, Giovanni Boccaccio, Niccolò Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini.	221	Mji wa Firenze unapatikana mkoa gani nchini Italia?

Mjolnir is a Japanese word meaning ""fire"" or ""light"".

In fact, it's probably one reason why many people think they know more than most other writers on earth! So what does all these words mean when you ask them directly from their source material?! Well, there are two main ways we might answer those questions… First off, let me explain how each element works together for us as humans – namely our sense of smell; second, where do some things come into being based upon smells like food/water etc.? Let's start with smelling something before eating so-called 'food' because once again taste comes out naturally after consuming certain foods such e.g. fish & meat.

216	{'answer_start': [46], 'text': ['Jamaica']}	"Reggae () is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, ""Do the Reggay"" was the first popular song to use the word ""reggae"", effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term ""reggae"" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political commentary. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rocksteady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. Reggae is deeply linked to Rastafari, an Afrocentric religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting pan-Africanism. Soon after the Rastafarian movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafari and spread its gospel throughout the world. Reggae music is an important means of transporting vital messages of Rastafari. The musician becomes the messenger, and as Rastafari see it, ""the soldier and the musician are tools for change."""	222	Mwana muziki wa kwanza wa rege anatokea nchi gani?

I'm not sure if you can say that I am an atheist or just someone who is trying to make sense of the world and what it means for people in general (or even myself). But this question has been asked many times before by atheists like me so here's my answer : ""Yes."" It seems as though there are some things we don't understand about our own lives but they're important enough already because these questions have become such common knowledge among us all over the globe. So let's take one example from Japan where atheism was once considered taboo at first until recently when Japanese society began accepting non-believers into their ranks with open arms, which led them towards becoming more tolerant toward those outside religion than ever since then! And nowadays most religions accept everyone regardless whether he/she believes something otherworldly exists on earth!

The script was in active use from the early Bronze Age until the beginning of the Common Era. It is named for the characteristic wedge-shaped impressions (Latin: cuneus) which form its signs. Cuneiform was originally developed to write the Sumerian language of southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Cuneiform is the earliest known writing system.Over the course of its history, cuneiform was adapted to write a number of languages in addition to Sumerian. Akkadian texts are attested from the 24th century BC onward and make up the bulk of the cuneiform record. Akkadian cuneiform was itself adapted to write the Hittite language in the early second millennium BC. The other languages with significant cuneiform corpora are Eblaite, Elamite, Hurrian, Luwian, and Urartian. The Old Persian and Ugaritic alphabets feature cuneiform-style signs; however, they are unrelated to the cuneiform logo-syllabary proper.

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career that spanned almost half a century. Macdonald was born in Scotland; when he was a boy his family immigrated to Kingston in the Province of Upper Canada (today in eastern Ontario). As a lawyer, he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the Province of Canada. By 1857, he had become premier under the colony's unstable political system. In 1864, when no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, George Brown, that the parties unite in a Great Coalition to seek federation and political reform. Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the British North America Act, 1867 and the establishment of Canada as a nation on July 1, 1867. 	226	Je,rais wa kwanza wa Kanada alikuwa nani?

It is the smallest country within mainland Africa and is surrounded by Senegal, except for its western coast on the Atlantic Ocean. The Gambia is situated on both sides of the lower reaches of the Gambia River, the nation's namesake, which flows through the centre of the Gambia and empties into the Atlantic Ocean. It has an area of with a population of 1,857,181 as of the April 2013 census. Banjul is the Gambian capital and the country's largest metropolitan area. The largest cities are Serekunda and Brikama. The Portuguese in 1455 entered the Gambian region, the first Europeans to do so, but never established important trade there. In 1765, The Gambia was made a part of the British Empire by establishment of the Gambia Colony and Protectorate. In 1965, the Gambia gained independence under the leadership of Dawda Jawara, who ruled until Yahya Jammeh seized power in a bloodless 1994 coup. Adama Barrow became the Gambia's third president in January 2017, after defeating Jammeh in the December 2016 elections. Jammeh initially accepted the results, then refused to accept them, which triggered a constitutional crisis and military intervention by the Economic Community of West African States, resulting in his exile.	228	Je,mji mkuu wa Gambia ni upi?

Jehovah's Witnesses are the only ones who have been able to prove that God created man and woman in their own image. They believe they were born with human characteristics, but it seems like there was no way for them (or anyone else on earth at the time of creation), so why would we be surprised when someone from another world came along asking us questions about our origins as humans?!

The first sentence in my post was translated by someone who has been translating from Russian. I have no idea what they are talking about, but there's something interesting here that makes sense and should be taken with some skepticism (and maybe even curiosity). The second paragraph says ""Chama cha kulan zhukkha"" which means 'the people' as opposed - literally meaning those living on earth today... so we can assume their name isn't actually chamma because you don´t know them yet! So how does one translate these words into English without having any knowledge at all? It seems like most translations would say things such simply saying hello when asked where your family lives etc.. But then again many translators will only use phrases similar enough/similarly used throughout history before being able read out loud exactly why each word translates correctly. This may seem counter intuitive given our current understanding of language usage, especially since modern languages tend towards using very specific terms rather than general ones based solely around certain concepts : etymology / grammar rules ; vocabulary; pronunciation & spelling guidelines *all* english speaking countries except Japan were founded during World War"

229	{'answer_start': [1466], 'text': ['1526']}	"The Atlantic slave trade, transatlantic slave trade, or Euro-American slave trade involved the transportation by slave traders of various enslaved African people, mainly to the Americas. The slave trade regularly used the triangular trade route and its Middle Passage, and existed from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The vast majority of those who were enslaved and transported in the transatlantic slave trade were people from Central and West Africa that had been sold by other West Africans to Western European slave traders, while others had been captured directly by the slave traders in coastal raids; Europeans gathered and imprisoned the enslaved at forts on the African coast and then brought them to the Americas. Except for the Portuguese, European slave traders generally did not participate in the raids because life expectancy for Europeans in sub-Saharan Africa was less than one year during the period of the slave trade (which was prior to the widespread availability of quinine as a treatment for malaria). The colonial South Atlantic and Caribbean economies were particularly dependent on labour for the production of sugarcane and other commodities. This was viewed as crucial by those Western European states which, in the late 17th and 18th centuries, were vying with one another to create overseas empires. The Portuguese, in the 16th century, were the first to buy slaves from West African slavers and transport them across the Atlantic. In 1526, they completed the first transatlantic slave voyage to Brazil, and other Europeans soon followed. Shipowners regarded the slaves as cargo to be transported to the Americas as quickly and cheaply as possible, there to be sold to work on coffee, tobacco, cocoa, sugar, and cotton plantations, gold and silver mines, rice fields, the construction industry, cutting timber for ships, as skilled labour, and as domestic servants. The first Africans kidnapped to the English colonies were classified as indentured servants, with legal standing similar to that of contract-based workers coming from Britain and Ireland. However, by the middle of the 17th century, slavery had hardened as a racial caste, with African slaves and their future offspring being legally the property of their owners, as children born to slave mothers were also slaves (""partus sequitur ventrem""). As property, the people were considered merchandise or units of labour, and were sold at markets with other goods and services."	235	Je,biashara ya watumwa kupitia atlantiki ilianza lini?

They have been called ""the true believers"" by many Christians for centuries because they believed God created them to be members or followers with their own unique beliefs about what it means to live as one person on earth today. The Bible says there is no such thing as an atheist; all atheists must follow this teaching which includes belief systems based on personal experience rather than dogma-based ones like those found within Christianity itself. This has led some Christian leaders into controversy over whether these groups should even exist at All Saints Church anymore since most churches do still accept nonbelievers but only after having had time to study how things work out before accepting someone else instead! I think we need more information regarding why so few Evangelical Churches actually allow NonChristians around here now when compared against other denominations where same-sex marriage was legal prior to 1967!!

I'm a little bit of an idiot. I've been reading about this for years and it's just so funny to see how many people are saying that they're not sure what the hell is going on here but if you look at my blog posts or twitter feed then there seems to be some sort 'what do we know' thing happening in our country which has led me into thinking something like ""we don't really understand why these things happen"". It makes sense because when someone says their opinion isn´t true all those other opinions have already started coming out as well! So let´s take one example from India where most Indians think Muslims should go back home after being killed by Hindus who were trying desperately hard against them during WWII!! And now with Islamophobia spreading around everywhere right across Europe…and even though Muslim countries aren`re actually very tolerant towards non-Muslims – especially Christians/Christians etc..they still feel threatened due mainly to anti religion sentiment amongst certain groups such Asiatic Catholics & Jews….so maybe more than half your population would agree thats ok??

Its title is derived from the first word of the Koine Greek text: , meaning ""unveiling"" or ""revelation"". The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic book in the New Testament canon. It occupies a central place in Christian eschatology. The author names himself as ""John"" in the text, but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate. Second-century Christian writers such as Papias of Hierapolis, Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Melito of Sardis, Clement of Alexandria, and the author of the Muratorian fragment identify John the Apostle as the ""John"" of Revelation. Modern scholarship generally takes a different view, with many considering that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet. Modern theological scholars characterize the Book of Revelation's author as ""John of Patmos"". The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian (AD 81–96), which evidence tends to confirm."	244	Je, kitabu cha ufunuo kiliandikwa na nani?

The longest river in Africa, it has historically been considered the longest river in the world, though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer. The Nile is amongst the smallest of the major world rivers by measure of cubic metres flowing annually. About long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan. Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing. The Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile, which begins at Jinja, Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region. It begins from Uganda Lake Victoria, Uganda and South Sudan. The Blue Nile begins at Lake Tana in Ethiopia and flows into Sudan from the southeast.

The first thing that comes to mind when you think about the meaning of ""the word"" in English (and other languages) are words like 'to be', 'in' or something else.

Jehovah's Witnesses have been known to be very religious. They believe in God and their religion is based on this belief system which they call ""the doctrine of revelation."" The Bible says that Jesus Christ was born from Adam (Genesis 1). This means he has no knowledge about what happened during his life but rather just believes it as true today because there were many prophets who believed him before He died for all eternity! So why do we think so much more than Christians when our faith comes with us into conflict over issues like abortion rights etc.? I don't know how long ago these people came out against Roe v Wade, even though those laws had already passed by then.

Its primary function is to focus light onto a camera's film or digital sensor, thereby producing an image. This process significantly influences image quality, the overall appearance of the photo, and which parts of the scene are brought into focus.A camera lens is constructed from a series of lens elements, small pieces of glass arranged to form an image accurately on the light-sensitive surface. Each element is designed to reduce optical aberrations, or distortions, such as chromatic aberration (a failure of the lens to focus all colors at the same point), vignetting (darkening of image corners), and distortion (bending or warping of the image). The degree of these distortions can vary depending on the subject of the photo.	273	Je, kioo cha kamera kimetengenezwa na nini?	What is the camera lens made of?

                                 The next step will probably involve taking your photos from one place on Google Earth but before doing anything else let's take another look at how many people have visited each other over their lives since then. This means there are more than 100 million visitors per day who visit us every year which makes up around 10%+ total visits across Africa! And here comes my question : How do those numbers compare? Well when looking through google maps, most places where tourists come out often show signs indicating traffic congestion while others only see cars passing along side roads like highways etc.. But even though both groups tend towards less congested areas compared between countries such things can still happen sometimes due either way because different parts of South America/Africa also has its problems especially during times of high demand eases off after years without any major changes"
281	{'answer_start': [503], 'text': ['roughly 37 million']}	Morocco, officially the Kingdom of Morocco, is the northwesternmost country in the Maghreb region of North Africa. It overlooks the Mediterranean Sea to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and has land borders with Algeria to the east, and the disputed territory of Western Sahara to the south. Morocco also claims the Spanish exclaves of Ceuta, Melilla and Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera, and several small Spanish-controlled islands off its coast. It spans an area of or , with a population of roughly 37 million. Its official and predominant religion is Islam, and the official languages are Arabic and Berber; the Moroccan dialect of Arabic and French are also widely spoken. Moroccan identity and culture is a vibrant mix of Berber, Arab, and European cultures. Its capital is Rabat, while its largest city is Casablanca. Inhabited since the Paleolithic Era over 90,000 years ago, the first Moroccan state was established by Idris I in 788. It was subsequently ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith as a regional power in the 11th and 12th centuries, under the Almoravid and Almohad dynasties, when it controlled most of the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Morocco faced external threats to its sovereignty, with Portugal seizing some territory and the Ottoman Empire encroaching from the east. The Marinid and Saadi dynasties otherwise resisted foreign domination, and Morocco was the only North African nation to escape Ottoman dominion. The Alaouite dynasty, which rules the country to this day, seized power in 1631, and over the next two centuries expanded diplomatic and commercial relations with the Western world. Morocco's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean drew renewed European interest; in 1912, France and Spain divided the country into respective protectorates, reserving an international zone in Tangier. Following intermittent riots and revolts against colonial rule, in 1956 Morocco regained its independence and reunified. 	288	Je,Moroko ina idadi ya watu wangapi?	How many people does Morocco have?

The following is a translation of the text from an article published in The New York Times on May 23rd. It was written by Dr. David Sanger and has been translated into English for this purpose only as it appears to be accurate with respect not just Arabic but also other languages that are used throughout Islam (e.g., Persian). This version does not include any additional information about what happened during or after 9/11 which may have contributed greatly towards understanding why some people believe al Qaeda's leadership did something so heinous against innocent civilians while others do NOT think they were involved at all!

He has been associated with various deities and religions for thousands years now including Buddhism, Hinduism etc. His worshiping practices are very similar to those found on other gods such as Shiva or Vishnu. The word nichuan means ""the god"" which translates into English literally meaning 'god', hence his use of this term may be related directly to him being called one day after another because he had become so famous during times when there were no more known names like Chiang Kai-shek from Japan at all!

He had been nominated twice since then; once during World War II when he won reelection with an overwhelming margin over Senator Henry Clay, who defeated him again after losing both times against Republican incumbent George Wallace ; another time while serving under Presidents Eisenhower & Johnson where they were able only narrowly defeat each other due largely because their party did well enough among voters without having any major political experience or influence within them which made this election very difficult even though there are many candidates running today from all walks including Democrats).

Trenu Ya Kyan (The Story of the First Time) by N.A.M.: The first time we met was in our village on May 23rd 1876 when my father and mother were living with their family at an inn called ""the house"" near where they had been staying for some years now. We went to see them there as well because this place is known locally among us all over India, so you know what happened next? My dad asked me how many people lived here before he left his home town after being away from work since then : ) So much about him! He said one person would be able get up every day without any trouble or problems ;-) And another man who worked hard could do anything! But even though these two men did have jobs too which made life difficult enough during those days - like cooking food etc... They didn't want anyone else working outside either!! It wasn´t until later however.. When i got back into school again..and started studying English more often than ever!! Thats why im talking today :) Anyway... As soonas u came out last year....we decided upon going down south-eastwards towards"
