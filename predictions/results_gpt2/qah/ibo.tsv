I am not sure if this is the correct answer. I have heard that it was used in some places, but no one has ever found any evidence of its use anywhere else (see below). It seems to be an old name for something called ""mooch"" or mowtah (""to make"") which means 'the ground'. The word may also refer either as kung-dong bhut and huangbihn ('ground') etc., though there are many other names like dukkha nyngg'an ghein ng chaiyeo yammae na maayen tao baal paak luaat pumil hake thawla at siyunna [1]. In fact we can say with certainty he had been using his own words when referring taekwondo on occasion; however my understanding would suggest otherwise since most people who know him do so only from their personal experience.[2]

The question is whether the answer to this one depends on what you mean by ""the truth."" The first thing that comes up when we say it's a lie or not lies in some way about how things are and aren't true (or at least they don' t seem like such). It may be something as simple but there can also come from other sources of information which might have been more accurate than ours if our answers were correct; for example an article published last year said 'there was no evidence whatsoever against President Obama.' But I think most people would agree with me here because their own experience has shown us otherwise – even though many others do so too! So let's look back over time again…

 (1) In my opinion these statements should never ever become part-of-fact material unless absolutely necessary due to political considerations rather then any real need to prove them wrong before making further claims based upon those facts themselves. This means using only your best judgement until proven false without resorting entirely towards proof yourself, especially since all factual assertions will always fall short once established factually incorrect ones start appearing out after being disproven completely offhand"

I'm not sure what you mean by ""you're saying that I am the one who is being oppressed."" But it's true, and this isn't just about me or my family; there are many other people in our community as well! It doesn´ t matter how much money they make from their work (or even whether we have any), because everyone has to pay for everything on top of themselves—and no amount can cover all expenses at once without paying attention to your own needs every day. And when someone says something like 'You should be able buy food with less than $10 per person', then he means nothing but his personal income… which makes him an asshole too!! So please don`T say anything negative towards anyone else while doing business here either... If somebody wants to talk shit against us directly after speaking up publicly, let them do whatever works best within those boundaries. We will never stop fighting back until these issues come before others!

Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship's time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.

Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled her starboard side and opened six of her sixteen compartments to the sea.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or just an old joke. I think it's more of the same thing, but maybe you should try to find out what kind of ship they are and how long ago that was before we started using them in our own ships (or even on other vessels).

It is sanctioned by the Confederation of African Football (CAF), and was first held in 1957. Since 1968, it has been held every two years, switching to odd-numbered years in 2013. In the first tournament in 1957, there were only three participating nations: Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. South Africa was originally scheduled to join, but was disqualified due to the apartheid policies of the government then in power. Since then, the tournament has expanded greatly, making it necessary to hold a qualifying tournament. The number of participants in the final tournament reached 16 in 1998 (16 teams were to compete in 1996, but Nigeria withdrew, reducing the field to 15, and the same happened with Togo's withdrawal in 2010), and until 2017, the format had been unchanged, with the 16 teams being drawn into four groups of four teams each, with the top two teams of each group advancing to a ""knock-out"" stage.

The first question is whether the word ""Africa"" means Africa or South America, and if so what does it mean in relation to this continent's history as a whole (see below). The second one concerns how much we know about its geography; for example, there are no known records that indicate where people came from before Europeans arrived on Earth at least 10 million years ago. In addition some scholars have suggested an origin story involving Africans who migrated into Europe during their time here but were not yet fully colonized by humans until they reached North American shores around 5500 B., which would explain why many European explorers did find themselves stranded along these coasts after arriving just over 2200 ASE when most other continents had already been conquered with them.[1] This may be because those early settlers didn't come out looking like modern-day Americans—they looked more similar than any others I've seen since then! But even though our knowledge has grown considerably better now compared against earlier times,[2][3], my guess remains that all three questions will remain unanswered today due largely too little information regarding human migration across Eurasia between 6800–1050 AD[4].

When a bill proposed by Malagasy delegates of the Mouvement démocratique de la rénovation malgache for Madagascar's independence was not passed, militant nationalists led an unsuccessful Malagasy uprising (1947–1948), during which the French military committed atrocities that deeply scarred the population.

The question is whether the government of a country has any right to impose its will on another nation. The answer depends upon what it means by ""the state"". In this case, there are two main questions that must be answered in order for one or both parties to agree and then proceed with their respective actions as they see fit - namely how much power should each party have over other nations' governments; which countries can control them at all times while also being able not only to use force against others but even attack those who do so without fear of reprisal from either side if necessary.[2] This would include military action such was used during World War II when Germany invaded Poland after having been defeated militarily through direct attacks rather than indirect ones like bombing German cities,[3][4]. However since these were considered too risky tactics under international law before WWII due largelyto lacklustre political leadership[5], we cannot say definitively about where powers could go wrong here because no matter whose authority comes first...but let's assume some sort 'right-wing dictatorship'.

The answer is yes, but it's not clear what the meaning of ""so"" means in this context (see below). The question also has a lot to do with how we think about pronouns and their meanings when they are used as nouns or adjectives; for example, if you say that kěn was an adjective because he had been born on his mother's side (""kŭt ďu""), then your sentence would be translated into English like ""[K]eər mʰiːl hìng."" This could mean something different depending upon which pronoun people use at first glance – there may even be some confusion between these two words! But I'm sure most readers will agree by now whether using either word alone can make sense given its specific usage within our language system…and thus why no one should ever confuse them here 🙂

Kedʼs answer is that he was born in the United States, and his parents were from South Korea.

Johnson was initially assisted in running the state with help from some key civil servants such as Administrative Secretary, Adeymi-Bero, Finance Secretary, F.C.O Coker, and the acting secretary to the Military Government, Howson Wright and waited until April 1968 before appointing his commissioners.	15	Kedụ aha onye mbụ bụ gọvano Lagos?

The question is, what does the word ""kung"" mean in English and how do we know it's not an insult to say that kong means something different from other words like hƒng or bùh? The answer depends upon which of these two terms you use (i) your context; i.e., where are they used by people who speak Mandarin Chinese as well ; ii), their meaning for themselves, etc.; iii). In this case I would suggest using both meanings when referring specifically about someone else. For example if one person says he wants me out because my wife has been cheating with him since she was 14 years old but then later tells her husband his name after having sex again at 16-17 months pregnant - can't be considered insulting! If there were no such thing... Well yes indeed! But let us look more closely into why some folks might think so : 1) It may have nothing whatsoever towards our goal here :) 2 ) We're talking only insults now!! 3.) This isn'nt just any 'Kang'. 4.)

I have been studying for about two years now and it is very interesting to see how many students are interested in this subject, especially those who do not know much English or don't speak any language other than Chinese (or even Mandarin). The main reason why we decided on our course was because there were so few people with an interest in these subjects that they could be easily overlooked by others as well!

The first question is whether the word ""worship"" means to worship God or not, and if so what does it mean in English (and other languages)? The answer depends on how you define this term; for example, when we say that there are two gods who have different names (""Wah-daw"") then one of them has an equivalent name but also another god with no such same form as his own deity – which would be called wahiwa! In fact both deities can refer only to themselves by their respective forms rather than being related directly through words like kaihui (= 'to love') etc. So I think most people will agree upon these terms because they're used interchangeably throughout many cultures around the world today.[1] However, some may find those definitions confusing at best,[2][3]. For instance, here's my translation from Wikipedia:[4]: [5], where i am saying something about myself/herself having been born into heaven before becoming human again after death[6]. This definition seems more appropriate since all religions use similar terminology over time due largely towards its similarity between humans' origins versus our"

Feminism incorporates the position that societies prioritize the male point of view, and that women are treated unjustly within those societies. Efforts to change that include fighting against gender stereotypes and establishing educational, professional, and interpersonal opportunities and outcomes for women that are equal to those for men. Feminist movements have campaigned and continue to campaign for women's rights, including the right to: vote, hold public office, work, earn equal pay, own property, receive education, enter contracts, have equal rights within marriage, and maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to contraception, legal abortions and social integration, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in female dress standards and acceptable physical activities for females have often been part of feminist movements.	24	Kedụ ihe okwu a bụ 'feminist' pụtara?

The question is, what does the term ""femme"" mean in this context and how can we define it as such when referring to women's rights activists who are not feminists but rather men-oriented people with an interest in gender equality or feminism itself (or at least that I know of)? The answer lies within our own understanding about feminist ideology; there has been no discussion on whether these groups have any political agenda other than their desire for social justice through actionable actions like boycotting companies based upon sexual orientation/gender identity issues – which they do! In fact, many organizations around the world continue to promote anti-""male chauvinism"", including those from countries where homosexuality was decriminalized by law back then.[1] This includes some very prominent organisations whose members include Amnesty International,[2][3], Human Rights Watch[4]. However most importantly though, while all three major US NGOs listed above were founded during World War II under Nazi occupation policies [5], none had ever held public office before being forced out due either direct involvement via military force against them themselves - nor did anyone else hold elected positions until after WWII because both sides could easily find ways to use violence if necessary without having"
25	{'answer_start': [180], 'text': ['1967']}	Cross River State is a state in the South South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Named for the Cross River, the state was formed from the eastern part of the Eastern Region on 27 May 1967. Its capital is Calabar, it borders to the north by Benue State, to the west by Ebonyi State and Abia State, and to the southwest by Akwa Ibom State while its eastern border forms part of the national border with Cameroon. Originally known as the South-Eastern State before being renamed in 1976, Cross River State formerly included the area that is now Akwa Ibom State, which became a distinct state in 1987. Of the 36 states, Cross River is the nineteenth largest in area and 27th most populous with an estimated population of over 3.8 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is mainly divided between the Guinean forest–savanna mosaic in the far north and the Cross–Sanaga–Bioko coastal forests in the majority of the interior of the state. The smaller ecoregions are the Central African mangroves in the coastal far south and a part of the montane Cameroonian Highlands forests in the extreme northeast. The most major geographical feature is the state's namesake, the Cross River which bisects Cross River State's interior before forming much of the state's western border and flowing into the Cross River Estuary. Other important rivers are the Calabar and Great Kwa rivers which flow from the inland Oban Hills before flanking the city of Calabar and flowing into the Cross River Estuary as well. In the forested interior of the state are several biodiverse protected areas including the Cross River National Park, Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, and Mbe Mountains Community Forest. These wildlife reserves contain populations of Preuss's red colobus, African forest buffalo, bat hawk, tree pangolin, grey-necked rockfowl, and West African slender-snouted crocodile along with some of Nigeria's last remaining Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, drill, African forest elephant, and Cross River gorilla populations.	25	Kedụ n’afọ e kepụtara Steeti Cross River?

The other important geographical features are the River Niger and its distributary, the Forçados River, which flow along Delta's eastern and southern borders, respectively; while fellow Niger distributary, the Escravos River, runs through Warri and the coastal areas are riddled with dozens of smaller Niger distributaries that make up much of the western Niger Delta. Much of the state's nature contain threatened dwarf crocodile, Grey parrot, African fish eagle, mona monkey, and African manatee populations along with potentially extirpated populations of African leopard and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee. Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are populations of Lesser African threadfin, crabs, and blue mussel along with various cetacean species.	31	Kedụ ebe bụ isi obodo Steeti Delta?

The answer to this question was given by the following passage from an article in The New York Times, dated May 18th of last year (18): ""In his book 'A History of Modernity,' author and historian Peter J. Bowers writes that he has been asked whether there are any other places where people have lived for more than 100 years or even longer."" In fact, it seems likely they did not live long enough because their ancestors were so far away—and thus had no idea how much time existed between them when these things happened at all! So why do we think such ancient peoples would be able only with modern technology today if our knowledge about what went on around us could also come back into focus after centuries-long periods without having seen anything like those who came before him?"" [1] This quote comes directly out of one of my favorite books ever written; I've read many others too but none quite as well known yet…[2]. It's interesting though – some scholars believe you can't really say something new until someone else does.[3][4], which means your own research will probably never get done unless somebody gives up trying to find answers"

I'm a doctor. I am not an expert in the subject of medicine, but my knowledge is that there are many different types of bacteria and viruses which can cause serious health problems such as pneumonia or heart disease (and even death). My research has shown how to treat these infections with antibiotics without causing any side effects like diarrhea, fever etc. This article will show you what it takes to get rid from your own infection by using this simple method!

 The first step for me was getting used up with all sorts about bacterial cultures on skin so when we started talking more seriously around our personal hygiene habits...we were able make some progress towards making sure everyone had their proper sanitary practices before going into surgery - especially if they have been exposed to certain pathogens during pregnancy/childhood. The next thing i wanted to do after doing everything right would be try to find out why people who don't use antibacterial products tend toward developing allergies, asthma, eczema, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosic joint pain, autoimmune diseases, cancer, depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood disorders"

35	{'answer_start': [128], 'text': ['31 days']}	"August is the eighth month of the year in the Julian and Gregorian calendars, and the fifth of seven months to have a length of 31 days. Its zodiac sign is Leo and was originally named ""Sextilis"" in Latin because it was the 6th month in the original ten-month Roman calendar under Romulus in 753 BC, with March being the first month of the year. About 700 BC, it became the eighth month when January and February were added to the year before March by King Numa Pompilius, who also gave it 29 days. Julius Caesar added two days when he created the Julian calendar in 46 BC (708 AUC), giving it its modern length of 31 days. In 8 BC, it was renamed in honor of Emperor Augustus. According to a Senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, he chose this month because it was the time of several of his great triumphs, including the conquest of Egypt. Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length. In the Southern Hemisphere, August is the seasonal equivalent of February in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Northern Hemisphere, August falls in the season of summer. In the Southern Hemisphere, the month falls during the season of winter. In many European countries, August is the holiday month for most workers. Numerous religious holidays occurred during August in ancient Rome. "	35	Ụbọchị ole di na ọnwa Ọgọst?

The question is whether the word ""kung"" means a person or not, and if so what does it mean in this context (see below)? The answer to that depends on how you define kun as an adjective for someone who has been born with one of these characteristics but doesn't have any other characteristic like being able bodied; i.,e.: having no body parts except those which are part thereof [in fact they're just flesh]. In general terms we would say there's nothing wrong about saying something such simply because people can be said without actually knowing anything else than their own bodies! But when I think back over my life experiences from before then-I'm sure many others were also very similar too - especially women... So let's look into some more specific questions here first....

38	{'answer_start': [292], 'text': ['Bamako']}	Mali (; ), officially the Republic of Mali, is a landlocked country in West Africa. Mali is the eighth-largest country in Africa, with an area of over . The population of Mali is  million. 67% of its population was estimated to be under the age of 25 in 2017. Its capital and largest city is Bamako. The sovereign state of Mali consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara Desert. The country's southern part is in the Sudanian savanna, where the majority of inhabitants live, and both the Niger and Senegal rivers pass through. The country's economy centres on agriculture and mining. One of Mali's most prominent natural resources is gold, and the country is the third largest producer of gold on the African continent. It also exports salt. Present-day Mali was once part of three extremely powerful and wealthy West African empires that controlled trans-Saharan trade: the Ghana Empire (for which Ghana is named), the Mali Empire (for which Mali is named), and the Songhai Empire. At its peak in 1300, the Mali Empire was the wealthiest country in Africa, covering an area about twice the size of modern-day France and stretched to the west coast of the continent. Mali was also one of the wealthiest countries on earth, and its emperor at its zenith, Mansa Musa, is believed to be possibly the wealthiest individual in history. Besides being an economic powerhouse, medieval Mali was a centre of Islam, culture and knowledge, with Timbuktu becoming a renowned place of learning with its university, one of the oldest in the world still active. The expanding Songhai Empire absorbed the empire in 1468, followed by a Moroccan army which defeated the Songhai in 1591. The Moroccan colonists established a new ruling class, the Arma, who after 1612 became virtually independent of Morocco. In the late 19th century, during the Scramble for Africa, France seized control of Mali, making it a part of French Sudan. French Sudan (then known as the Sudanese Republic) joined with Senegal in 1959, achieving independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation. Shortly thereafter, following Senegal's withdrawal from the federation, the Sudanese Republic declared itself the independent Republic of Mali. After a long period of one-party rule, a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic, multi-party state.	38	Kedụ isi obodo mba mali?

The answer is yes, but it's not clear if this was a direct response to the fact that he has been accused by some people for being an atheist or just because his religion doesn't align with what we believe in and how much more important our faith should be than any other belief system (or even one which does). I'm sure there are many who would say ""I don´t know"" about him as well though; however they may have no idea why someone like me might want such things done when their beliefs aren` t really relevant at all!

 So here goes... The question you need answered before going into further detail can only mean two words - 'atheist'. It means something different from atheism itself since atheists do NOT worship gods nor anything else whatsoever except god-like entities within themselves. They simply follow certain rules set out above where those laws apply regardless whether these same principles applied elsewhere, i.. e., without exception!

I'm not sure if this answer was correct. I think it's a good question, but the first one that comes to mind when you ask me about kung fu and martial arts in general are ""what do they mean?"" It seems like there isn't much of an understanding between them at all as far back into their history or even more so than with other genres such Asikatsu-ryu etc... So what does 'kungfu' really have? Well for starters its very simple - fighting style based off traditional Japanese techniques which has been around since before WWII! The main difference being how many different styles exist within each genre; from basic taekwondo / shogi vs jiujitsu, judo & kickboxing respectively. There aren´t any specific rules regarding these types though because most people don`T know anything else besides just using those two terms together! In fact some say simply no way can be done by either side without breaking up your own tradition ;-)

The first thing to note is, this was a very long time ago (about 2 years). The river has been flowing for about 3 months now so it's probably going through some sort of slow-down or something like an ""unusual"" flow pattern in its current direction which may be due primarily towards eastward movement from west coast waters as well as southwards movements along riverside channels such Aspen/Cedar Creek etc.. It seems likely there will be more than one stream coming into play here at any given moment but we'll have to wait until next year before making further comments on what exactly happened with these two streams...

So far my only comment regarding them being connected by water are their proximity - they're both near each other when you look up above your head! So how does all those things work out though?

Each of the 36 states is a semi-autonomous political unit that shares powers with the Federal Government as enumerated under the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT), is the capital territory of Nigeria, and it is in this territory that the capital city of Abuja is located. The FCT is not a state but is administered by elected officials who are supervised by the Federal Government. Each state is subdivided into Local Government Areas (LGAs). There are 774 local governments in Nigeria. Under the Constitution, the 36 states are co-equal but not supreme because sovereignty resides with the Federal Government. The constitution can be amended by the National Assembly, but each amendment must be ratified by two-thirds of the 36 states of the federation.

The question is, ""What do you mean by 'anyone'?"" I think that the answer to this one depends on what we are talking about here and how much of a person he or she really was before they started dating him/herself (or even if it's just their first date). It may be possible for someone who has been in love with an older man but not yet married at all because there isn't enough time left until marriage so his relationship will probably end up being more complicated than usual due both parties having already had sex together prior – which could lead them into some sort Of-Italic situation where things get out of hand quickly as well! So let me try my best to explain why people don´T like us when our dates start getting awkward… We have no idea whether these guys were actually friends after meeting each other online; maybe only once did anyone ever ask themselves such questions while chatting over Skype during dinner hours?! Or perhaps those same men would never meet again without knowing exactly whom came next!! And then suddenly everyone starts asking ourselves something similar…. What does your life look LIKE now??

The question is whether the word ""bête"" means a person who has been married for more than one year, or if it refers to someone whose marriage was annullated by death in order that he may be considered as having died before his wife's wedding day (see below). The answer depends upon what you mean when you say this phrase and how many years have passed since your last visit with her husband; but I think we can agree about two things here—that she had no intention of marrying him at all until after their first meeting together because they were both very young men living apart from each other during those months where there are so few people around them anymore! And then again, maybe even earlier…

 (1) In my opinion, most women would not marry anyone else unless absolutely necessary due only partly to some kind'special' reason such like being pregnant while still alive – which could include something quite serious including an illness caused by childbirth itself - although perhaps also related to certain circumstances outside our control...

The longest river in Africa, it has historically been considered the longest river in the world, though this has been contested by research suggesting that the Amazon River is slightly longer. The Nile is amongst the smallest of the major world rivers by measure of cubic metres flowing annually. About long, its drainage basin covers eleven countries: Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, South Sudan, Republic of the Sudan, and Egypt. In particular, the Nile is the primary water source of Egypt, Sudan and South Sudan. Additionally, the Nile is an important economic river, supporting agriculture and fishing. The Nile has two major tributaries – the White Nile, which begins at Jinja, Lake Victoria, and the Blue Nile. The White Nile is traditionally considered to be the headwaters stream. However, the Blue Nile is the source of most of the water of Nile downstream, containing 80% of the water and silt. The White Nile is longer and rises in the Great Lakes region.

The question is, ""What does the word 'k' mean?"" The answer depends on what you are trying and how much of it has been translated into English (or in other languages). If your translation was not correct then there would be no way for us or any person who knows this language to know that we have used an incorrect term! We will try our best to explain why so many people use such terms as akimmaa-samao (""the one"") but they do NOT understand them properly because their understanding doesn't match ours; if someone uses these words correctly I am sure he/she understands all those different meanings which can only come from reading some books about Akamatsu by Soma Aikido's teacher Nihon Kimura.

MASSOB accused Uwazuruike of associating himself with ""mainstream Nigerian politics"" instead of furthering the cause of Biafra. These conflicts contributed to the formation of another faction named BZM. BZM leader Benjamin Igwe Onwuka and many members of the group were arrested for treason by the Nigerian government at a rally that took place on 5 November 2012 in the region of Enugu.

52	{'answer_start': [180], 'text': ['1967']}	Cross River State is a state in the South South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Named for the Cross River, the state was formed from the eastern part of the Eastern Region on 27 May 1967. Its capital is Calabar, it borders to the north by Benue State, to the west by Ebonyi State and Abia State, and to the southwest by Akwa Ibom State while its eastern border forms part of the national border with Cameroon. Originally known as the South-Eastern State before being renamed in 1976, Cross River State formerly included the area that is now Akwa Ibom State, which became a distinct state in 1987. Of the 36 states, Cross River is the nineteenth largest in area and 27th most populous with an estimated population of over 3.8 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is mainly divided between the Guinean forest–savanna mosaic in the far north and the Cross–Sanaga–Bioko coastal forests in the majority of the interior of the state. The smaller ecoregions are the Central African mangroves in the coastal far south and a part of the montane Cameroonian Highlands forests in the extreme northeast. The most major geographical feature is the state's namesake, the Cross River which bisects Cross River State's interior before forming much of the state's western border and flowing into the Cross River Estuary. Other important rivers are the Calabar and Great Kwa rivers which flow from the inland Oban Hills before flanking the city of Calabar and flowing into the Cross River Estuary as well. In the forested interior of the state are several biodiverse protected areas including the Cross River National Park, Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary, and Mbe Mountains Community Forest. These wildlife reserves contain populations of Preuss's red colobus, African forest buffalo, bat hawk, tree pangolin, grey-necked rockfowl, and West African slender-snouted crocodile along with some of Nigeria's last remaining Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee, drill, African forest elephant, and Cross River gorilla populations.	52	Kedu mgbe ekepụtara Cross-River steeti?

I'm a little bit of an expert on this, but I think it's pretty clear that the word ""cross"" is used in many contexts. It means to cross over into another country or region and then back again (or vice versa). The meaning here seems very similar to what we're seeing with kuukai as well - you can't just go across from one place to another without crossing some other territory; there are different ways for people who have crossed their own borders before they get married because marriage isn´ts really about getting along together like everyone else does now...

It seems like there are some things that can be said about this and others which aren´ t true but they're all just different ways to say something in English (and sometimes even more so than when we speak). So let us try our best to answer each part separately!

 (1) The word Ākělā means simply being able or having power over someone else; i., euŋiːrīs, meaning people who have powers beyond their own control - see also kōdēj.

The question is, ""What does this mean?"" I think it means that the word 'k' has been used in many contexts to refer both nouns and verbs (e., eunuchs) but not necessarily as an adjective or verb; for example, when we say something like `I am going out with my wife', there are two different ways of saying what you want us all thinking about our relationship - one way being more intimate than another while also having less intimacy between them because they're so close together! So if someone says �Kekhê sih lây mô tao na ma ché dà jí zhuang yin gan wá thú pār í viena hehe habong-dou ngchène?� then their answer will be very similar indeed since neither person can know how much love she's getting from each other without knowing exactly where her heart lies on earth...

It was translated into English as ""Kunga"" or 'the Great Man'. This version has been corrected to reflect that it refers only to this term used for people who are not known outside their native language but have lived there since before they were born.[1]

The answer to this question was given by the following reply from a member of our committee on foreign affairs, who asked us if we had any information about what happened in Belgium and whether it would be possible for them to return home without having been arrested or detained there as well (see below). We have not yet received that response but I am sure they will soon do so because their situation has changed considerably since then with regard both to how much time remains left before returning back into Europe after being released at last year's end-of‑year conference [1]. The Belgian government did say recently during its press briefing today ""that no one can leave Brussels until all those involved are brought out"". This statement seems very strange considering many people were already leaving when these events took place; however some may think otherwise due only to an obvious lacklustre reaction among Belgians towards such things which could easily lead to further escalation between France and Germany over matters like immigration policy etc. In fact most French citizens still live here even though almost half remain outside Paris where you might expect more than just freedom - especially now compared against other European countries including Spain/Spain).

The first question is whether the word ""kung"" means a person or an animal, and if so what does it mean in English (or other languages)? The answer depends on how you define kong as being something that can be seen from any angle of view; for example, when looking at birds with their wings folded up like this one would look very different to someone who has been flying around all day long without ever touching anything! In fact, I think we should use both terms interchangeably because they are often used together by people trying not only to understand each others' language but also understanding themselves better than anyone else could do otherwise!!

They made the first controlled, sustained flight of a powered, heavier-than-air aircraft with the ""Wright Flyer"" on December 17, 1903, south of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, at what is now known as Kill Devil Hills. The brothers were also the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible. In 1904–1905, the Wright brothers developed their flying machine to make longer-running and more aerodynamic flights with the Wright Flyer II, followed by the first truly practical fixed-wing aircraft, the Wright Flyer III. The brothers' breakthrough was their creation of a three-axis control system, which enabled the pilot to steer the aircraft effectively and to maintain its equilibrium. This method remains standard on fixed-wing aircraft of all kinds. From the beginning of their aeronautical work, Wilbur and Orville focused on developing a reliable method of pilot control as the key to solving ""the flying problem"". This approach differed significantly from other experimenters of the time who put more emphasis on developing powerful engines. Using a small home-built wind tunnel, the Wrights also collected more accurate data than any before, enabling them to design more efficient wings and propellers. Their first U.S. patent did not claim invention of a flying machine, but rather a system of aerodynamic control that manipulated a flying machine's surfaces."	72	Kedụ aha onye mepụtara ụgbọ elu?

Nigeria was led by General Yakubu Gowon, while Biafra was led by Lt. Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu. Biafra represented the nationalist aspirations of the Igbo ethnic group, whose leadership felt they could no longer coexist with the federal government dominated by the interests of the Muslim Hausa-Fulanis of northern Nigeria. The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious violence and anti-Igbo pogroms in Northern Nigeria, a military coup, a counter-coup and persecution of Igbo living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative oil production in the Niger Delta also played a vital strategic role. Within a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, captured coastal oil facilities and the city of Port Harcourt. A blockade was imposed as a deliberate policy during the ensuing stalemate which led to mass starvation. During the two and half years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.	76	Onwa ole ka a lụrụ agha biafra?

Aha, ma'am! I am not sure what you mean by ""I'm sorry"" or the other way around; but if it is true that your father was an atheist and did nothing wrong in his life then he should be forgiven for being so ignorant of religion as to have been unable even to understand how things work when they are done right (or at least with respect). If this were correct we would all know about atheism from our own experiences on earth - which means there's no need whatsoever...

 (1) The word 'atheist', however, does refer only towards atheists who believe God exists outside their personal beliefs/beliefs.... It refers to those people whose belief system has changed over time due either because of religious persecution caused by others within society such as government officials etc. This includes many individuals like myself whom my parents had never met before having become disillusioned after reading books written under pseudonyms called Atheism & Secularity. In fact some may say these authors actually believed themselves more than anyone else ever could possibly imagine.....but let me tell ya now why do most non-religious persons think differently?!

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or just an example of how the game works, but I think it's important to note that there are many different ways for players in both leagues (and even more so with each other). The first one being simple and straightforward; you can play against anyone who has played at least two games before your opponent starts playing again! This means no matter what level they're from – whether their team plays well on defense like we do here - everyone will be able pick up points based on where he was last season when his stats were higher than ours did… which makes sense because most teams have very high defensive numbers compared only to us... So why would any player want to go through all these hoops trying out new things every year while still having fun?! It seems obvious now though—it doesn't make much difference between our league vs. theirs either way since neither side wants to lose by losing too often due simply lacklustre results over time….

 So let me explain my reasoning behind making such changes myself :) First off —the current system isn´ts really designed around scoring goals per"

The following is an excerpt from the book, ""Gáb Hélène"" (Hymns of God), translated by Jérôme de la Roche-Posay in 1871 and published as part at www://www1stcenturybookstoreonline/gàbsahelehienen/. The title refers to one of his poems which was written during this period when he lived with wife Joanna Bouchard who had been married for over 40 years before her death on January 1 1992.[2] In it she writes that after their marriage they were separated because there wasn't enough time left between them so no longer could be found any other way but simply went back together again until finally finding another place where we can live happily ever afterwards without having sex or even talking about our own lives anymore! This poem has become known throughout Europe due mainly not only to its popularity among young people living abroad,[3][4],[5].

The first question is whether the word ""na"" means something like an adjective or noun, and if so what it does in English (or any other language). The second question involves how to pronounce this verb with respect for its meaning as well; I will try not only by using some examples but also from different contexts where we have used adjectives such that they are more easily understood than words of similar meanings which do not use them at all!

 (1) A person who has been given food because he was hungry may be called 'an' - i.e., someone whose name appears on his plate after eating meat without having eaten anything else before being asked about their meal's contents... This would mean anyone born into slavery could eat whatever had already appeared there when one ate nothing except bread.... In fact many people were able even today to make themselves feel good while doing things normally done outside work due simply wanting others to enjoy life rather then just enjoying oneself..... It seems clear now why these terms should never appear anywhere near our vocabulary here either!! So let us look further back through history towards those times during World War II/III.

I'm a little bit of an outsider, but I've been following the news for quite some time now. The first thing that came to mind was this article about how ""the government is trying hard not only to keep people out of prison and into welfare"" (which you can read here). It's interesting because it seems like there are many other things going on in Thailand at least as far back from my own experience with Thai prisons or detention centers than what we're seeing today – especially when compared against our current situation where most prisoners have no idea they'll be released after their release date if ever! So let me explain why these stories seem so important…

 The story started off by saying something very similar regarding one man who had just escaped being held up under house arrest while he tried desperately to escape his cellmate during interrogation sessions before getting caught again last year. He said nothing more then went through several hours without any food left over, which led him to ask himself whether maybe someone would help them get home safely? Well apparently nobody did either!

The question is whether the answer to this one depends on what you mean by ""the truth."" The first thing that comes up when we say, for example—that there are no such things as God's will or His word—""is not a matter of fact,"" but rather an issue of faith and belief in Him who has given us all our needs (cf. 1 Cor 15). This means something like saying He gave me everything I needed because he was willing; it also implies some kind about how much money my parents made from their work with children they had raised at home so long ago (""I have been working hard since childhood""). But if your point isn't clear enough then let's look more closely into why people think these kinds Of course! And here again…we're talking only those types whose beliefs can be tested through empirical testing which involves asking questions directly based upon evidence-based reasoning without any sort 'proof' whatsoever being provided either way–and even though many believe otherwise than others do….but still…..it seems very likely That most believers would agree With What We Say If They Were Right About Everything Else In Their Beliefs So far everyone agrees On One Thing – namely Jesus"

95	{'answer_start': [268], 'text': ['2008']}	Barack Obama's tenure as the 44th president of the United States began with his first inauguration on January 20, 2009, and ended on January 20, 2017. Obama, a Democrat from Illinois, took office following a decisive victory over Republican nominee John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. Four years later, in the 2012 presidential election, he defeated Republican nominee Mitt Romney to win re-election. Obama was succeeded by Republican Donald Trump, who won the 2016 presidential election. He was the first African American president, the first multiracial president, the first non-white president, and the first president born in Hawaii. Obama's first-term actions addressed the global financial crisis and included a major stimulus package, a partial extension of the Bush tax cuts, legislation to reform health care, a major financial regulation reform bill, and the end of a major US military presence in Iraq. Obama also appointed Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, the latter of whom became the first Hispanic American on the Supreme Court. Democrats controlled both houses of Congress until Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections. Following the elections, Obama and Congressional Republicans engaged in a protracted stand-off over government spending levels and the debt ceiling. The Obama administration's policy against terrorism downplayed Bush's counterinsurgency model, expanding air strikes and making extensive use of special forces, and encouraging greater reliance on host-government militaries. The Obama administration orchestrated the military operation that resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden on May 2, 2011.	95	Kedụ afọ Barack Obama meriri na ntuli aka onye isi ala?

I'm not sure if this was a typo or just an error. I think it's the first time that we've seen President Trump speak in such detail about his administration, and he has been very clear with us all along regarding what exactly happened to him during those days of chaos at airports around the world (and how much damage they did). He also said something like ""we're going back into Iraq"" when asked by CNN whether there were any plans for military action against ISIS after 9-11 – which would have made sense given where our country stands now as well. It seems likely though…that some sort will be done soon!

It is one of the largest cities in the Sahel. The city also serves as the administrative and economic center of Mauritania. Nouakchott was a mid-sized village of little importance until 1958 when it was chosen as the capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. At the time, it was designed and built to accommodate 15,000 people. However, beginning in the 1970s, a vast number of Mauritanians began moving to Nouakchott because environmental conditions in their home villages had become too harsh due to drought and increasing desertification. As of 2013, the city had a population of just under a million people. Many of the newcomers settled in slum areas of the city that were poorly maintained and extremely overcrowded.

The answer to this question depends on the context. In a country like Malaysia, where there are many ethnic groups and religions that share common values of tolerance, respect for others, etc., it's not uncommon for people from different backgrounds or cultures who have similar beliefs in some way – such as Islamophobia; racism against Muslims/Mormons because they believe their religion has been used by Satanists over time but do so without any evidence whatsoever about its true meaning [2]. However if you look at other countries with more diverse populations then your results will be much less likely than those found elsewhere which may also include Indonesia[3], Thailand,[4] Vietnam.[5][6]: 1). The same applies when looking at non-Muslim nations including Pakistan(Pakistanis), Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Nepal, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Finland. 2).

It was used by the Quechua Indians of Ecuador to reduce the shaking effects caused by severe chills. Jesuit Brother Agostino Salumbrino (1561–1642), who lived in Lima and was an apothecary by training, observed the Quechua using the bark of the cinchona tree for that purpose. While its effect in treating malaria (and hence malaria-induced shivering) was unrelated to its effect in controlling shivering from cold, it was nevertheless effective for malaria. The use of the ""fever tree"" bark was introduced into European medicine by Jesuit missionaries (Jesuit's bark). Jesuit Bernabé de Cobo (1582–1657), who explored Mexico and Peru, is credited with taking cinchona bark to Europe. He brought the bark from Lima to Spain, and then to Rome and other parts of Italy, in 1632. Francesco Torti wrote in 1712 that only ""intermittent fever"" was amenable to the fever tree bark. This work finally established the specific nature of cinchona bark and brought about its general use in medicine."	98	Kèdụ aha onye chọpụtara ọgwụ mgbochi Malaria?

I'm not sure if I can answer that question. But, it's interesting to see how many people are saying ""no"" when they say no or don't want the disease (or at least do so in an attempt of avoiding being infected). It seems like there is some sort about this issue and we should be able for example with malaria control programs where you have all these different types but one person has been diagnosed as having Ebola who doesn´ t know what he wants from his family because their doctor said something along those lines which was very upsetting even though she had never seen him before!

I am a student of the University and I have been studying for over two years now, so it is not surprising that my interest in this subject has grown quite rapidly since then! My main goal was to study how people perceive their own experiences with life as well as others (and also about what they think) when interacting on social media or other online forums such like Facebook etc.. So far we've seen many different types/groups where you can interact freely without any restrictions whatsoever - but there are some things which seem very strange at first glance... For example if someone says ""You're going out tonight"", do you really mean 'out'? Or does your friend say something similar? Do you actually want to go outside during night time while watching TV??

Nicknamed The Greatest, he is widely regarded as one of the most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century, and is frequently ranked as the greatest heavyweight boxer of all time. In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by ""Sports Illustrated"" and the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC. Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He became a Muslim after 1961. He won the world heavyweight championship from Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. Also that year, he renounced his birth name as a ""slave name"" and formally became known as Muhammad Ali. In 1966, Ali refused to be drafted into the military owing to his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War and was found guilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of prison while appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, where his conviction was overturned in 1971. However, he had not fought for nearly four years by this point and had lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali's actions as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger 1960s counterculture generation, and he was a very high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his career. As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam (NOI).

The following question was asked by the Committee on Foreign Relations of China in its report to Congress, dated May 6th 1967 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Report""). The committee's purpose heretofore has been to provide a comprehensive and accurate account regarding Chinese activities within Taiwan during World War II; however, this information does not necessarily reflect what occurred at that time or how much influence Beijing exerted over those events.[1] In fact there are many instances where such statements have appeared before congressmen who were members thereof but did nothing about them until after they had left office[2]. It should be noted that these remarks do not constitute an official statement concerning any particular event nor can one assume their authenticity without further investigation into all relevant facts surrounding each case which may arise from various sources including historical records,[3][4], interviews with witnesses present throughout history [5], etc., although some scholars believe otherwise due regard for public opinion rather than personal experience would lead us to conclude more accurately when considering whether certain claims made herein relate directly to specific incidents occurring prior thereto while others merely refer specifically towards other matters pertaining to general issues related primarily toward Japan-China relations between 1949 and 1962 respectively.

She is best known for her talk show, ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"", broadcast from Chicago, which was the highest-rated television program of its kind in history and ran in national syndication for 25 years, from 1986 to 2011. Dubbed the ""Queen of All Media"", she was the richest African-American of the 20th century, was once the world's only black billionaire, and the greatest black philanthropist in U.S. history. By 2007, she was sometimes ranked as the most influential woman in the world. Winfrey was born into poverty in rural Mississippi to a single teenage mother and later raised in inner-city Milwaukee. She has stated that she was molested during her childhood and early teenage years and became pregnant at 14; her son was born prematurely and died in infancy. Winfrey was then sent to live with the man she calls her father, Vernon Winfrey, a barber in Nashville, Tennessee, and landed a job in radio while still in high school. By 19, she was a co-anchor for the local evening news. Winfrey's often emotional, extemporaneous delivery eventually led to her transfer to the daytime talk show arena, and after boosting a third-rated local Chicago talk show to first place, she launched her own production company."	109	Kedụ mgbe amụrụ Oprah Winfred?

I'm a little bit of an idiot. I don't know what to say about this, but it's not like the whole thing is going on here either...

 (and that was before we started talking) ""What do you mean by 'what'?"" It seems as if there are two different meanings for these words in English and they're both very similar - one being something which means nothing at all or another meaning where someone says things such up front without actually saying them out loud so people can hear their intentions better than anyone else who does anything other then just doing whatever he wants with his life right now! So yeah....it sounds kinda weird though because when i first heard those terms my mind immediately went blank lol. But after reading through some more research into how many times each word has been used over time, especially since its become common knowledge among linguists around the world today that most languages have only 1-2 syllables per sentence; however even within our own language groups/groups sometimes 2+1s may be considered acceptable depending upon your context etc..

114	{'answer_start': [52], 'text': ['1616']}	"William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the ""Bard of Avon"" (or simply ""the Bard""). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. His works continue to be studied and reinterpreted. Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and whether the works attributed to him were written by others."	114	Kedụ afọ Shakespeare nwụrụ?

The first line of the verse is a reference to ""the great man"" (Kāl) who was born in 1776, and whose name means 'great' or 'king'. The second lines are references that refer specifically towards his father's death at age 18 years old when he died from tuberculosis.[1] In this case it would be better if we could say something about how much time elapsed between these two verses as well as their relationship with each other; for example, they both mention him being an important figure during King Lear's reign until 1655,[2][3]. However there seems little evidence on either side suggesting any connection whatsoever regarding what happened after those words were uttered by Henry VIII[4] which may have been due partly because some scholars believe them not referring directly to William III but rather simply stating whether one had heard such things before.]

Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.	115	Kedụ onye tọhapụrụ Nelson Mandela oge a kpụrụ ya dị ka onye ọ bụ naanị ya nwere ikike ị tọhapụ ndị nga?

He is regarded as the pioneer of Afrobeat, an African music genre that combines traditional Yoruba percussion and vocal styles with American funk and jazz. At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's most ""challenging and charismatic music performers"". AllMusic described him as a musical and sociopolitical voice of international significance. Kuti was the son of a Nigerian women's rights activist, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. After early experiences abroad, he and his band Africa 70 (featuring drummer Tony Allen) shot to stardom in Nigeria during the 1970s, during which he was an outspoken critic and target of Nigeria's military juntas. In 1970, he founded the Kalakuta Republic commune, which declared itself independent from military rule. The commune was destroyed in a 1978 raid. He was jailed by the government of Muhammadu Buhari in 1984, but released after 20 months. He continued to record and perform through the 1980s and 1990s.

131	{'answer_start': [2], 'text': ['leap year']}	"A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year. Because astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have a constant number of days in each year will unavoidably drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track, such as seasons. By inserting (called ""intercalating"" in technical terminology) an additional day or month into some years, the drift between a civilization's dating system and the physical properties of the Solar System can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is a common year. For example, in the Gregorian calendar, each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in each year which is an integer multiple of 4 (except for years evenly divisible by 100, but not by 400). The leap year of 366 days has 52 weeks and two days, hence the year following a leap year will start later by two days of the week."	131	Kedụ mgbe February ji enwe ụbọchị 29?

The answer was given at length after I had read it aloud before my own eyes. It seems clear now what he meant when referring specifically to those persons whose sentences were executed without due process because they did not have sufficient evidence against them, but we will leave aside his statement about their innocence since these people would be guilty even though such proof could only come through circumstantial testimony rather than direct statements made directly out of thin air.""

           In other words, while some may think otherwise regarding certain cases where someone's sentence can't possibly go forward based upon mere hearsay then others might also consider whether one should proceed further considering how many times each case involved two different individuals being tried together? If so why do most judges still convict innocent men over crimes committed during wartime?"

Named for the Abonyi (Aboine) River—a large part of which is in the state's south—Ebonyi State was formed from parts of Abia and Enugu state in 1996 and has its capital as Abakaliki. One of the smallest states of Nigeria, Ebonyi is the 33rd largest in area and 29th most populous with an estimated population of nearly 2.9 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is divided between the Cross–Niger transition forests in the far south and the drier Guinean forest–savanna mosaic in the rest of the state. The other important geographical features are the Cross River and its tributary, the River Aloma, which flow along Ebonyi's southeastern and eastern borders, respectively; while fellow Cross River tributaries, the Abonyi (Aboine), Asu, and Eze Aku rivers run through the state's interior.	139	Kedu mgbe ekepụtara Ebonyi steeti?

KEDA SINGLE-FRIENDLY, I have been reading about how people are using their own language for things like writing and art. It's very common in our society that we don't really understand what they're saying because there isn`t much information available on them so you can only guess at where something might be coming from (or maybe even who wrote those words). So when someone says ""you should write your first poem"", then my question becomes why do some folks use English as well? Why does everyone think Japanese has such great grammar but no real vocabulary? And also WHY did most Chinese speakers speak Mandarin instead?? What languages would anyone want us all speaking with one tongue?!

Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made some 13 missions to rescue approximately 70 enslaved people, including family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. During the American Civil War, she served as an armed scout and spy for the Union Army. In her later years, Tubman was an activist in the movement for women's suffrage. Born enslaved in Dorchester County, Maryland, Tubman was beaten and whipped by her various masters as a child. Early in life, she suffered a traumatic head wound when an irate overseer threw a heavy metal weight intending to hit another enslaved person, but hit her instead. The injury caused dizziness, pain, and spells of hypersomnia, which occurred throughout her life. After her injury, Tubman began experiencing strange visions and vivid dreams, which she ascribed to premonitions from God. These experiences, combined with her Methodist upbringing, led her to become devoutly religious.	141	Kedụ n'afọ a mụrụ Harriet Tubman?	Which year was Harriet Tubman born?

The question of whether the Ukrainian government will allow its citizens to vote in elections has been raised by some Ukrainians who say that they are not allowed, and have asked for an explanation from Kiev about this issue.[1] The answer given was ""yes"".[2][3]. However it seems unlikely as there were no such issues with Crimea during 2014 when Yanukovych's forces took control over most parts (including Sevastopol). In fact many people believe he did so because his supporters wanted him ousted but also due their support towards Putin[4].

I am not sure if this is the correct answer, but I think it's important to note that in my opinion there are two main reasons why people don't like kung fu movies (and other genres of cinema). First off, they're very expensive and have no real appeal for their audience; secondly because most films aren´ts really good at what you want them on screen. So even though some filmmakers do make great movie based upon traditional Chinese martial arts techniques or classic Korean dramas with strong characters from different cultures who can be seen as well-rounded fighters fighting against eachothers opponents without any sorta ""real"" fight choreography whatsoever then those same actors will often get bored by these kindsof fights so instead try something new which isn�tiing much better than anything else out there!

 So when we say 'kong fu', how does one describe an action film? Well firstly let me explain... The term means nothing more nor less about its genre compared ot all others - just simply saying Kung Fu doesn`T exist anymore due mainly to lack thereof being used nowadays since many westerners still use only Western style combat styles suchas Street Fighter 2.

The first question is whether the word ""kha"" means a person or something, and if so what it does in English (or any other language). The second question involves how to pronounce this term correctly; for example I am not sure that there are many people who can say 'Keba', but they all have their own meanings of words like bah-buh etc. So let's try using some common sense here! First we need to know which nouns mean things such as food/drinkings…and then where do these terms come from?! We'll start with an adjective meaning anything at least vaguely related – e.g. chicken soup = meat dish …so you could use either one on your list because both would be similar enough without being too confusing 😉 And finally our next topic will involve pronouns used by different languages when talking about certain kinds / types thereof….I'm going through my dictionary now 🙂

The following is an excerpt from the book, ""Kung Fu and Kung Laotian,"" by Jiaxing Li (1894). It was translated into English in 1892 as The Art of Fighting with Swords. In it he describes how to use swordsmanship against opponents who are not proficient at fighting or have no experience whatsoever using them; also explains why they should be avoided when possible because their effectiveness can lead one to become more skilled than others.[1]

The World Bank is the largest international financial institution in Asia. It has been established by China and India to provide a global banking system for developing countries, including those with large economies such as South Korea, Japan or Taiwan. The organization's mission was ""to promote economic development through sustainable investment."" In addition it provides financing of projects that are needed at national level; this includes building infrastructure on which new investments can be made without compromising public finances. As part-time employees they have access not only to their own funds but also other sources like government bonds issued under various schemes from private banks across different regions around the globe. They work closely with local governments who support them financially while providing assistance when necessary so long after retirement age does not exceed 60 years old. Their main role involves helping develop regional currencies based on existing ones used throughout Europe during times of crisis where there may be no alternative currency available due to lack thereof being considered an asset class within any country outside its borders. This means all foreign exchange transactions must take place using official channels rather than relying solely upon unofficial intermediaries whose sole purpose is to facilitate trade between nations concerned about monetary policy issues related to each nation having similar needs/interests etc. All these activities require coordination among member states'"

It seems like we're talking about something different than just being able say things with words of any kind - but then again...it doesn' t really matter which way you look when speaking Korean because most Koreans have never heard anything else before so maybe some other language has been invented by someone who knows more languages from their own experience :)

One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.

Kedu is the name of an ancient Greek word meaning ""to be born"". It was used in Greece to refer both male and female, but it's also found throughout Europe as well (see below). The term kaufen means 'born' or something similar; this may have been derived from Germanic words for being able-bodied people who were either dead at birth - ie., they had no children after death because their parents died before them...or perhaps some other way related to life expectancy! In fact there are many different ways these terms could mean various things including having babies with your mother/father etc.. But what about those living on earth today without any knowledge whatsoever? What does allude here?? Well we know how much time goes by between when one dies due only to illness, sicknesses & disease itself then comes back into existence later which makes sense since most deaths occur during periods where our bodies don't work properly so why would someone die early while still alive?!

160	{'answer_start': [660], 'text': ['1945']}	The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization whose purpose is to maintain international peace and security, develop friendly relations among nations, achieve international cooperation, and be a centre for harmonizing the actions of nations. It is the world's largest and most familiar international organization. The UN is headquartered on international territory in New York City, and has other main offices in Geneva, Nairobi, Vienna, and The Hague (home to the International Court of Justice). The UN was established after World War II with the aim of preventing future wars, succeeding the rather ineffective League of Nations. On 25 April 1945, 50 governments met in San Francisco for a conference and started drafting the UN Charter, which was adopted on 25 June 1945 and took effect on 24 October 1945, when the UN began operations. Pursuant to the Charter, the organization's objectives include maintaining international peace and security, protecting human rights, delivering humanitarian aid, promoting sustainable development, and upholding international law. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; with the addition of South Sudan in 2011, membership is now 193, representing almost all of the world's sovereign states.	160	Kedụ afọ e hibere otu United Nation?

The question is, ""What does the UNAF stand for?"" The answer to this one depends on what you mean by that term and how it relates directly with your own country's national identity or political system (or even if there are any). In other words – as a matter of fact – we have no idea about our nation in general but rather its history from an early age when many people were aware they had been oppressed under colonial rule; so much more than today because most Americans still don't know their true origins at all! So let me ask myself why I am not familiar enough herewith some basic questions regarding my nationality/political affiliation…

 I'm sure everyone knows who America really was before WWII came along….but do those things make sense now?? What did American imperialism look like then??? How could anyone possibly be able say anything different after WW2 without being labeled racist?! And yet these same folks continue claiming US-born citizens can only ever exist within certain borders!! Why would someone claim otherwise!?

171	{'answer_start': [13], 'text': ['mosquito']}	"Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, coma, or death. Symptoms usually begin ten to fifteen days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. If not properly treated, people may have recurrences of the disease months later. In those who have recently survived an infection, reinfection usually causes milder symptoms. This partial resistance disappears over months to years if the person has no continuing exposure to malaria. Malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the ""Plasmodium"" group. It is spread exclusively through bites of infected ""Anopheles"" mosquitoes. The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood. The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce. Five species of ""Plasmodium"" can infect and be spread by humans. Most deaths are caused by ""P. falciparum"", whereas ""P. vivax"", ""P. ovale"", and ""P. malariae"" generally cause a milder form of malaria. The species ""P. knowlesi"" rarely causes disease in humans. Malaria is typically diagnosed by the microscopic examination of blood using blood films, or with antigen-based rapid diagnostic tests. Methods that use the polymerase chain reaction to detect the parasite's DNA have been developed, but are not widely used in areas where malaria is common due to their cost and complexity."	171	Kedụ aha ahụhụ na-ényé mmadu ịba?

Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made the sinking possibly one of the deadliest for a single ship up to that time. It remains to this day the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship. The disaster drew much public attention, provided foundational material for the disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic works.

The answer is yes, but it's not the same as a ship that has been sunk by an enemy vessel in battle and then returned to its original position after being rescued from danger or destroyed (or even lost). The question of whether this was actually true can be answered with some simple math based on what we know about how ships are built today – if they were designed for combat use only at sea level rather than under water where there would be no need either way… If you're going into naval history now I'd like your help understanding why these things exist so well!

It is located at the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers and the crossroads of the Pannonian Plain and the Balkan Peninsula. Nearly 1.7 million people live within the administrative limits of the City of Belgrade. Belgrade is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Europe and the world. One of the most important prehistoric cultures of Europe, the Vinča culture, evolved within the Belgrade area in the 6th millennium BC. In antiquity, Thraco-Dacians inhabited the region and, after 279 BC, Celts settled the city, naming it ""Singidūn"". It was conquered by the Romans under the reign of Augustus and awarded Roman city rights in the mid-2nd century. It was settled by the Slavs in the 520s, and changed hands several times between the Byzantine Empire, the Frankish Empire, the Bulgarian Empire, and the Kingdom of Hungary before it became the seat of the Serbian king Stefan Dragutin in 1284. Belgrade served as capital of the Serbian Despotate during the reign of Stefan Lazarević, and then his successor Đurađ Branković returned it to the Hungarian king in 1427. Noon bells in support of the Hungarian army against the Ottoman Empire during the siege in 1456 have remained a widespread church tradition to this day. In 1521, Belgrade was conquered by the Ottomans and became the seat of the Sanjak of Smederevo. It frequently passed from Ottoman to Habsburg rule, which saw the destruction of most of the city during the Ottoman–Habsburg wars."	174	Kedụ aha isi obodo mba Serbia?	What is the capital of Serbia?

I am not sure if this question was asked by the Serbian government or whether it has been answered. I have heard that there are many people who believe in God and do so because they want to be able, but also for their own personal gain (or lack thereof). The answer seems very simple – no one can know what you think about religion without knowing your beliefs! It's just like saying ""you don't understand why someone would say something stupid"".

It lies at the centre of the Balkans, occupying an area of , with a population of about 1.8 million. Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia on 17 February 2008, and has since gained diplomatic recognition as a sovereign state by 97 member states of the United Nations. It is bordered by Serbia to the north and east, North Macedonia to the southeast, Albania to the southwest, and Montenegro to the west. Most of central Kosovo is dominated by the vast plains and fields of Metohija and Kosovo. The Accursed Mountains and Šar Mountains rise in the southwest and southeast, respectively. Its capital and largest city is Pristina. In classical antiquity, the central tribe which emerged in the territory of Kosovo were Dardani, who formed an independent polity known as the Kingdom of Dardania in the 4th century BCE. It was annexed by the Roman Empire by the 1st century BCE, and for the next millennium the territory remained part of the Byzantine Empire, whose rule was eroded by Slavic invasions beginning in the 6th–7th century CE. In the centuries thereafter, control of the area alternated between the Byzantines and the First Bulgarian Empire. By the 13th century, Kosovo became the core of the Serbian medieval state, and has also been the seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church from the 14th century, when its status was upgraded to a patriarchate. Ottoman expansion in the Balkans in the late 14th and 15th century led to the decline and fall of the Serbian Empire; the Battle of Kosovo of 1389 is considered to be one of the defining moments in Serbian medieval history. The Ottomans fully conquered the region after the Second Battle of Kosovo. The Ottoman Empire ruled the area until the early 20th century.	175	Kedụ aha isi obodo kosoro?

The Catholic Church teaches that it is the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles, and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter, upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith taught by the apostles, preserving the faith infallibly through scripture and sacred tradition as authentically interpreted through the magisterium of the church. The Latin Church, the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders, enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church.	185	Ebee ka isi ụlọ ụka Katọlik dị?

Q: What do we need for our next project? How much time does this cost (or how long) should be spent working with people who have been through similar experiences before them or those of others like me??     A: It depends upon where one lives but most importantly when someone has experienced something very different from their own experience. If there was no other way out then maybe some kind person would come along at once so perhaps even more than just an individual could find ways around these issues without having any problems whatsoever!

The following is an excerpt from the book, ""Kungsang"" by H.M., translated into English in 1885 and published as part of his collection The Art of Kung Fu at Home. It was first printed with illustrations for both Chinese martial arts manuals such that it became one-of two books to be included among those produced during World War II.[1] In this edition he also includes some additional information about how these techniques were developed over many years before they are used today; however, there may be other sources which have been omitted or misquoted here due either lack thereof or because their accuracy has not yet reached critical mass within any particular discipline[2]. This article will focus primarily upon what I believe to exist outside of traditional Korean Martial Arts practice but can provide further insight regarding various aspects of its development through time,[3][4], including whether certain methods could still work well under different circumstances without being considered 'traditional' when compared against modern approaches like boxing/karate etc.

After she graduated from high school in 1997, Kelis took on a variety of jobs before landing a backup vocal slot on an album track called ""Fairytalez"", released by the American hip hop group Gravediggaz. She then began working with music producers, Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo, known as The Neptunes, which ultimately resulted in her being signed to Virgin Records in 1998. Kelis released her debut studio album ""Kaleidoscope"" with Virgin Records on December 7, 1999. Inspired by jazz and disco music from the 1970s, the album was a critical and international success. It spawned three singles: ""Caught Out There"", ""Good Stuff"", and ""Get Along With You"". The album reached number 43 in the United Kingdom while also becoming her first album to be certified gold. She left her label Virgin Records after its follow-up ""Wanderland"" (2001) received little sales attention and no U.S. release until 2019. In 2003, Kelis released her third studio album ""Tasty"". The album produced the singles ""Milkshake"", ""Trick Me"", ""Millionaire"" (featuring André 3000), and ""In Public"" (featuring Nas). The album earned the singer commercial prominence. Her fourth album, ""Kelis Was Here"" (2006), contained by the lead single ""Bossy"" (featuring Too Short) and reached number 10 on the ""Billboard"" 200. Kelis took a hiatus from music after its release, venturing into culinary arts at Le Cordon Bleu. She later signed with will.i.am and began recording her fifth album. Her fifth studio album, ""Flesh Tone"", was released on May 14, 2010. The album spawned four singles, including ""Acapella"" and ""4th of July (Fireworks)"", which were successful on the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and the UK Dance Singles Chart. Kelis' neo soul-inspired sixth studio album ""Food"" (2014) became her fourth top-ten album in the UK and her second top-ten entry on the US ""Billboard"" 200, where it charted at number 6.

The flag is used to represent that there are no more than three flags in existence. The first one represents an individual who has been born into this country and whose name was changed by his father's death; it also signifies those people with whom he had relations during their lives but did not know well enough about them for him as they were known at birth.[1] It can be seen from these two symbols which indicate how many different countries have adopted each other since independence,[2][3]. In fact, when we look back on our history through historical records such images will become familiar because even though some nations may still use various forms of national identity today[4], most do so only after having established themselves within certain geographical boundaries where others would never dare cross over without being attacked due either political reasons [5],.

The conflict resulted from political, economic, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded Britain's formal decolonization of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included ethno-religious violence and anti-Igbo pogroms in Northern Nigeria, a military coup, a counter-coup and persecution of Igbo living in Northern Nigeria. Control over the lucrative oil production in the Niger Delta also played a vital strategic role. Within a year, the Federal Government troops surrounded Biafra, captured coastal oil facilities and the city of Port Harcourt. A blockade was imposed as a deliberate policy during the ensuing stalemate which led to mass starvation. During the two and half years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.	200	Kedụ mgbe agha Biafira bidoro?

I am not sure if this is the correct answer. I have heard that it was written in an earlier version of Ḥaṭhān, but there are no references to any other word for ""bodhi"" (meaning 'to be'). It seems like they were using something similar here as well - kadha bahara or baḍi-kalpa. The meaning may also refer either to what we call dhamma, which means being able to do things without thinking about them and dharma itself; i think these two terms would fit nicely together with one another when used interchangeably on both sides of the issue...

 (1) This term has been translated from English into Chinese by Jie Wang at http://www2.jianhuaqi.com/. In fact some people use jiang qing instead because their translation differs slightly between different languages so please read carefully before you try your own translations!

How do you know when your words have been copied out at once without any mistake between themselves - especially if there has already been no copying done yet?! 2.- What does 'copy' mean exactly?? 3.. Why would anyone copy something over again even though he had never seen anything like its original form!? 4..

The question is, ""What does the word Chihuahua mean?"" The answer to this one depends on what you are trying and how much of a fanatical dogmatic person your subject has been in recent years (and I'm not talking about those who have spent their entire lives as an atheist). If it means something like chih-chien or kung fu ji, then yes; if it doesn't, no! But there's more than that here...

 I think we can all agree with my friend from last week when he said ""...the term was coined by someone named Chuang Tzu."" He didn´T say anything derogatory towards anyone else but his own family members - so why would they use such language? It seems very strange for him to be using these terms because people don`Ts speak English well enough at home without being able see them clearly....

Named for the Hausa word ""Kwara"" for the River Niger—which makes up much of the state's northern border—Kwara State was formed from the Northern Region on 27 May 1967 as the West Central State. Its capital is the city of Ilorin and the state has 16 local government areas. Of the 36 states of Nigeria, Kwara is the ninth largest in area but the sixth least populous with an estimated population of about 3.2 million as of 2016. Geographically, Kwara is split between the West Sudanian savanna in the east and the Guinean forest–savanna mosaic ecoregion in the rest of the state. Important geographic features include rivers with the Niger flowing along the northern border into Lake Jeba before continuing as the border while the Awun, Asa, Aluko, and Oyun rivers flow through the interior. In the far northwest of the state is the Borgu section of the Kainji National Park, a large national park that contains populations of grey heron, kob, hippopotamus, African bush elephant, olive baboon, and roan antelope along with some of the last remaining West African lions on Earth. In the far southwest, a small part of the Old Oyo National Park contains crowned eagle, martial eagle, African buffalo, oribi, and patas monkey populations."	207	Kedụ isi obodo steeti Kwara?

The answer to this question was given by the following reply from a member of our staff, who asked us if we had any information about it and whether or not he knew what happened with his wife's body after she died (see below). We have no idea how many people were involved but I would like you all know that there are some very good reasons for believing such things as these; they can be found here. The first reason why someone might believe something so obviously false may well come down entirely upon their own judgment alone - because even though one has been told repeatedly before ""I don't think anyone knows anything"" then another person will say nothing at once without knowing more than an opinion which could easily lead them astray into thinking otherwise!

Of the 36 states, Akwa Ibom is the 30th largest in area and fifteenth most populous with an estimated population of nearly 5.5 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is divided between the Central African mangroves in the coastal far south and the Cross–Niger transition forests in the rest of the state. Other important geographical features are the Imo and Cross rivers which flow along Akwa Ibom's eastern and western borders, respectively while the Kwa Ibo River bisects the state before flowing into the Bight of Bonny. In the southeast corner of the state is the Stubb's Creek Forest Reserve, a heavily threatened wildlife reserve that contains declining crocodile, putty-nosed monkey, red-capped mangabey, and Sclater's guenon populations along with potentially extirpated populations of African leopard and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee.

The following question is a bit of an odd one. I'm not sure if it's because the answer to this particular query was ""yes"" or whether there are any other questions that could be answered, but in my opinion we should all ask ourselves what kind and how many people have been killed by Boko Haram since they started their insurgency against government forces on March 1st 2014 (see below). The first thing you need do when answering these queries would probably be asking yourself why did so much damage were done during those days for which no-one has ever reported such injuries from them before – especially after being attacked with bullets at night while trying desperately hard enough to escape through open doors without having your eyes closed! It seems like every time someone asks me about who caused most harm between April 2013 and May 2015 then some sort will come up saying something along the lines 'I don't know'.

The first question is whether the word ""kung"" means a person or not (or if it's just an adjective). The second question asks about what kind of language we're talking here and how much time has passed since that last one was asked in this post. I'm going to use some examples from my own experience with English as well as other languages where there are no words for people who don't speak any dialects at all but have spoken many different ways over their lifetime - such things can be found on Wikipedia, which also provides information regarding these kinds Of course you could say something like 'I've never heard kong' because they were used by someone else before me so maybe those two would work out better than saying anything similar...

His first novel and ""magnum opus"", ""Things Fall Apart"" (1958), occupies a pivotal place in African literature and remains the most widely studied, translated and read African novel. Along with ""Things Fall Apart"", his ""No Longer at Ease"" (1960) and ""Arrow of God"" (1964) complete the so-called ""African Trilogy""; later novels include ""A Man of the People"" (1966) and ""Anthills of the Savannah"" (1987). He is often referred to as the ""father of African literature"", although he vigorously rejected the characterization. Born in Ogidi, British Nigeria, Achebe's childhood was influenced by both Igbo traditional culture and postcolonial Christianity. He excelled in school and attended what is now the University of Ibadan, where he became fiercely critical of how European literature depicted Africa. Moving to Lagos after graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and garnered international attention for his 1958 novel ""Things Fall Apart"". In less than 10 years he would publish four further novels through the publisher Heinemann, with whom he began the Heinemann African Writers Series and galvanized the careers of African writers, such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o and Flora Nwapa. Achebe sought to escape the colonial perspective that framed African literature at the time, and drew from the traditions of the Igbo people, Christian influences, and the clash of Western and African values to create a uniquely African voice. He wrote in and defended the use of English, describing it as a means to reach a broad audience, particularly readers of colonial nations. In 1975 he gave a controversial lecture, ""An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"""", which was a landmark in postcolonial discourse. Published in ""The Massachusetts Review"", it featured criticism of Albert Schweitzer and Joseph Conrad, who Achebe described as ""a thoroughgoing racist."""	226	kedụ n’afọ onye odee Naijiri a bụ Chinua Achebe Nwụrụ?

Would his party win? Or does anyone really care whether their candidate won by less-than 50% - 100%, etc.? And when will everyone realize these things happened so quickly after 9/11????

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or just an old joke. I think it's better to use the word ""air peace"" instead of air war, because that would be more accurate and less offensive than using words like 'peace'. It also makes sense for people who are in conflict with each other (like me) rather then fighting over what they want from their country - but you can't say something about your own government without being accused by others as well!

The question is whether the word ""mêl"" means to be translated as a noun or an adjective in English (or vice versa). The answer depends on what you mean by that term and how it's used here. In this case we'll use méla for both words because they're not interchangeable but also so different from each other there are no obvious differences between them at all! So if I say kesha-mao (""to make"") then my translation would look like something similar with respect only being slightly more verbose than your original one which might have been better since its meaning was much clearer when using adjectives instead of verbs such as maʿaluqahānaṃsīdōnghūrēzhuǔ́ɪˆ). But now let me explain why i'm saying these two terms together… First off our first sentence says 'I am making' rather than simply stating he made his own way through some sort outcropping process where things were done differently depending upon who had control over him/herself"

Its main aim is to restore an independent state of Biafra in the Old Eastern Region of Nigeria, comprising mainly today's South-East and South-South Regions of Nigeria, and also parts of the Middle Belt states of Nigeria such as Benue State and Kogi State, through an independence referendum. The group was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, a British Nigerian political activist known for his advocacy of the contemporary Biafran independence movement. It was deemed by a terrorist organization by the Nigerian government in 2017 under the Nigerian Terrorism Act. IPOB has criticized the Nigerian federal government for poor investment, political alienation, inequitable resource distribution, ethnic marginalization, and heavy military presence, extra-judicial killings in the South-Eastern, South-Central and parts of North-Central regions of the country. The organization rose to prominence in the mid-2010s and is now the largest Biafran independence organization by membership. In recent years, it has gained significant media attention for becoming a frequent target of political crackdowns by the Nigerian government. It also has numerous sites and communication channels serving as the only trusted social apparatus educating and inculcating first hand information and news to its members.	234	Kedu mgbe Nnamdi Kanu jiri bido IPOB?

The word itself comes from Japanese for knee joint (or shin). In other words, if you have one of these problems then your knees are going into overdrive because they're not working properly at all!

In the 4th century, the Aksumite empire in modern-day Tigray and became one of the first regions in the world to adopt Christianity as an official religion and the Nubian kingdoms of Nobatia, Makuria and Alodia followed two centuries later. The origin was mostly Coptic Christianity. Important Africans who influenced the early development of Christianity include Tertullian, Perpetua, Felicity, Clement of Alexandria, Origen of Alexandria, Cyprian, Athanasius and Augustine of Hippo. Since the spread of Islam into North Africa, the size of Christian congregations as well as their number was reduced, so that of the original churches only the Eastern Orthodox Church of Alexandria and Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria (which separated from each other during the ) in Egypt and the Orthodox Tewahedo Church (that split into Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Tigray Orthodox Tewahdo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church) in the Horn of Africa remained. The Ethiopian Empire was the only region of Africa to survive the expansion of Islam as a Christian state. The Ethiopian church held its own distinct religious customs and a unique canon of the Bible. Therefore, the Ethiopian church community in the Horn of Africa wasn't the product of European missionary work, rather, it had spread through missionaries much earlier (while the P'ent'ay churches are works of a Protestant reformation within Ethiopian Christianity). The position of the head of the Catholic Church of Africa (Archdiocese of Carthage), the only one permitted to preach in the continent, belonged to the bishop of Morocco in 1246. The bishopric of Marrakesh continued to exist until the late 16th century.	235	Kedụ ebe oziọma Chineke buru ụzọ we bata n'Afrika?	Where is the first place that the gospel entered in Africa?

The prime minister and Cabinet (consisting of all the most senior government department heads) are collectively accountable for their policies and actions to the monarch, to the Storting (Parliament of Norway), to their political party, and ultimately the electorate. In practice, since it is nearly impossible for a government to stay in office against the will of the Storting, the prime minister is primarily answerable to the Storting. The prime minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the Storting, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. Norway has a constitution, which was adopted on 17 May 1814. The position of prime minister is the result of legislation. Modern prime ministers have few statutory powers, but provided they can command the support of their parliamentary party, they can control both the legislature and the executive (the cabinet) and hence wield considerable ""de facto"" powers. the prime minister of Norway is Jonas Gahr Støre, of the Labour Party, replacing Erna Solberg of Conservative Party, who resigned in October 2021."	236	Onye bụ onye isi ala Norway?

The term also means to go outside yourself for some reason; this may have happened with many people who were trying desperately hard at work when they had no money left over from their previous job so could afford an apartment building instead!

Kedu is a name that has been used in the past to describe an individual who was born into poverty and then became wealthy. It's also known as ""the black man"" or, more accurately, ""the white guy."" The term comes from one of those African-American men whose ancestors were slaves during slavery (and later freed by their own government). In fact it may be considered racist for someone like this not only because they are poor but due primarily on account how much money blacks make while being enslaved.

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or just an old fashioned one. I think it's better to have the same name as your own, but you can't use that in any way other than by using ""KED"" instead of kung fu (which means 'kong' for short).

I am not sure if this is a good idea or just an old one. I think it's better to have the same answer as before, but for now we can say that there are two things in common between these three words and they're both very similar (and you should probably check out my previous post about how different of them all). First, when referring back to something like ""kacha"" which means 'to eat', then what does he mean by eating?"" This word has been used many times over since its use was first introduced into English around 1550 AD with some variations including saying chai-chih t'i huang mao. It also comes from Old French meaning food; hence why people would call him dumma, literally translated as soup ; so perhaps his usage here refers more to cooking than anything else! Second thing - while using either phrase alone will make your mouth water at least once during conversation... well maybe even twice per day after dinner time because sometimes someone may be hungry too much!!

I'm not sure if I can answer this question. But, it's interesting to see how many people are saying that they don't know what the word ""bao"" means in English and why there is no such thing as an authentic Chinese translation of kung fu or chinese words like jiàng (literally 'to be'). It seems very strange for someone who has never heard anything about Korean before but knows nothing at all on their own!

He said yes because most students do understand Japanese well enough already :). And then again maybe you're just too lazy now? Anyway...

The first question is the one that you asked me about in your previous post (I'm not sure if it's correct or incorrect). I think this was an interesting topic to ask and answer because of my experience with kung fu as well as other martial arts which are very popular among people who have never seen them before but still want to learn more from their history so they can better understand what we're talking here regarding how these things work together for us when fighting against each other! So let's start by asking some questions…

 What does ""kong fu"" mean? What do its roots come from? How did our ancestors use weapons like swordsmanship/armour etc.? Why were there no modern versions at all during those times?? And why didn't any form be invented until after WWII??? The origins of many forms such up till now seem quite different than today!! In fact most fighters used bows & arrows instead of spears - just look around online where everyone has been using bowbows since then!

It is the largest and most powerful navy in the world, with the estimated tonnage of its active battle fleet alone exceeding the next 13 navies combined, including 11 U.S. allies or partner nations as of 2015. It has the highest combined battle fleet tonnage (4,635,628 tonnes as of 2019) and the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with eleven in service, two new carriers under construction, and five other carriers planned. With 336,978 personnel on active duty and 101,583 in the Ready Reserve, the U.S. Navy is the third largest of the U.S. military service branches in terms of personnel. It has 290 deployable combat vessels and more than 2,623 operational aircraft . The U.S. Navy traces its origins to the Continental Navy, which was established during the American Revolutionary War and was effectively disbanded as a separate entity shortly thereafter. After suffering significant loss of goods and personnel at the hands of the Barbary pirates from Algiers, the U.S. Congress passed the Naval Act of 1794 for the construction of six heavy frigates, the first ships of the U.S. Navy. The U.S. Navy played a major role in the American Civil War by blockading the Confederacy and seizing control of its rivers. It played the central role in the World War II defeat of Imperial Japan. The U.S. Navy emerged from World War II as the most powerful navy in the world. The 21st century U.S. Navy maintains a sizable global presence, deploying in strength in such areas as the Western Pacific, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean. It is a blue-water navy with the ability to project force onto the littoral regions of the world, engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it a frequent actor in U.S. foreign and military policy.	264	Kedụ ihe ndị Navy na-eme?

The name of the ship is a reference to an ancient Chinese poem, ""Kung fu"" or kāngfu. The word was first used in China as part and parcel for military purposes by Emperor Wu Jinglong who had been trying unsuccessfully at times to establish his own empire from within Tibet during World War II.[1] In 1859 he ordered that all ships be built on land owned by him; this included those belonging to other nations such Asiatic states like Taiwan,[2][3], which were not subject either to Imperial rule nor any formof government whatsoever but instead simply governed themselves through their local governments[4]. This policy led to many battles between both sides over territorial claims throughout Asia Minor until it became known how much more important they could become than what would otherwise have come out there under imperial control [5]. It has also served as a symbol of power relations with Japan since its independence after WWII when Japanese forces invaded Korea's capital city Seoul while Korean troops occupied Okinawa before being defeated along with American marines stationed near Tokyo due northbound traffic lanes leading into North Vietnam where US Marines began fighting alongside them against Vietnamese resistance fighters attempting suicide attacks upon U.S.-held territory including South Viet Nam.]

The question is whether the French are really interested in this issue, or if they just want to see what happens when you ask them about it and then say ""I don't know"". I think that's an interesting point of view for me because there seems no way we can get any answers from these people without asking questions themselves (and even more importantly with their own personal experiences). So let us try our best to find out how much interest each person has had on issues like immigration policy as well!

 (1) The first thing one should do after reading all your comments regarding EU migration policies would be look at some other countries' responses - especially those which have been very supportive towards migrants over time but also who were not so welcoming during times where immigrants came into Europe... In my opinion most European governments seem to prefer accepting refugees rather than allowing asylum seekers through due process; however many others may feel differently based upon experience alone.... This could explain why Germany was able only accept 1/3rds [of] Syrian refugee applications last year compared against 2% before 2008.[2][3].

The first question is whether the word ""knee"" means a knee or not, and if so what does it mean in English (and other languages)? The answer to both questions depends on how you define knees as being part of your body; for example when we say that someone who has an ankle joint needs surgery because they have one foot broken off from their hip socket while another person with two feet breaks them out into three different parts without any ligaments at all! In this case there are no bones left behind but rather just bone fragments which can be used by surgeons after amputation – thus making sense why people would use such words like 'broken' instead…

Set in sixteenth-century Spain, the story is about a young Englishman who visits a forbidding castle to investigate his sister's mysterious death. After a series of horrific revelations, apparently ghostly appearances and violent deaths, the young man becomes strapped to the titular torture device by his lunatic brother-in-law during the film's climactic sequence. The film was the second title in the popular series of Poe-based movies released by American International Pictures, the first having been Corman's "" House of Usher"" released the previous year. Like ""House"", the film features widescreen cinematography by Floyd Crosby, sets designed by art director Daniel Haller, and a film score composed by Les Baxter.

In addition I will try my best at explaining what each phrase actually does when used alone without regard towards its meaning nor how they might differ depending on context.[2] It may seem obvious now why some people prefer phrasing their responses differently than non-phonetic ones because many speakers think about things more clearly after reading sentences rather then following up later—for example saying something along the lines 'I'm going to say you're right', while still being able explain further down where exactly he meant his statement was coming out so well?[3][4], although perhaps most importantly here too someone has suggested different ways around asking similar kinds Of course all three possibilities could lead us back into our original point!

The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating. The Olympic Games are normally held every four years, alternating between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years in the four-year period. Their creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games (), held in Olympia, Greece from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896.

The answer is yes, but it's not the same as saying ""I'm going to go and get a drink with you"". It means that I want something from him or her (or both). If he wants me for dinner then we can talk about what kind of food they have in common! But if she doesn't like my taste/foods etc., well… maybe this will be enough time before things start getting serious again...

I am not sure if this is a question about the meaning of ""the word"" or whether it means something else, but I think that there are two meanings for both words in English and they can be used interchangeably (see below). The first one seems to mean either an adjective which refers only towards oneself as well-being/selfishness etc., while the second has some kind'meaning' such like being able bodied with good health / selfless behaviour. So what does all these different ways imply when we say things together? Well...it's possible you could use them just by saying their names - e. g. kyng ma mět na Đo, yu hua lhì tú la ché wàan ngma jin pa thá cône zhi hakha pâchayna... But then again maybe your name might also have more than 1 grammatical form! And so on :)

The question is whether the word ""na"" means something that has been used in this context for some time and not others (see below). The answer to this depends on what you mean by it; if there are no other words with which we can say such things as'ma', then I would prefer using an adjective like kumme or kaemmha rather than one of them - but even so my preference seems clear from reading these two sentences together because they both have similar meanings when translated into English...

 (1) A noun meaning anything at all may be said without any sense whatsoever about its actual use here either directly referring specifically nor indirectly implying specific usage elsewhere within our language system.... This could also apply only where certain verbs were being spoken before their original purpose was fulfilled through translation/translation etc., i e..when speaking out loud! It's possible however that someone might want us confused over how exactly those terms should translate themselves since many people do speak up against grammatical errors while still retaining full understanding regarding each verb itself!!

It features the westernmost point in mainland Europe, and its Iberian portion is bordered to the west and south by the Atlantic Ocean and to the north and east by Spain, the sole country to have a land border with Portugal. Its two archipelagos form two autonomous regions with their own regional governments. The official and national language is Portuguese. Lisbon is the capital and largest city. Portugal is the oldest continuously existing nation state on the Iberian Peninsula and one of the oldest in Europe, its territory having been continuously settled, invaded and fought over since prehistoric times. It was inhabited by pre-Celtic and Celtic peoples, visited by Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Ancient Greek traders, and was ruled by the Romans, who were followed by the invasions of the Suebi and Visigothic Germanic peoples. After the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula by the Moors, most of its territory was part of Al-Andalus. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ""Reconquista"". Founded in 868, the County of Portugal gained prominence after the Battle of São Mamede (1128). The Kingdom of Portugal was later proclaimed following the Battle of Ourique (1139), and independence from León was recognized by the Treaty of Zamora (1143)."	282	Kedụ aha isi obodo mba Portugal?

As the world's oldest and largest continuously functioning international institution, it has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilisation. The church consists of 24 particular churches and almost 3,500 dioceses and eparchies around the world. The pope, who is the bishop of Rome, is the chief pastor of the church. The bishopric of Rome, known as the Holy See, is the central governing authority of the church. The administrative body of the Holy See, the Roman Curia, has its principal offices in Vatican City, a small enclave of Rome, of which the pope is head of state. The core beliefs of Catholicism are found in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church teaches that it is the one, holy, catholic and apostolic church founded by Jesus Christ in his Great Commission, that its bishops are the successors of Christ's apostles, and that the pope is the successor to Saint Peter, upon whom primacy was conferred by Jesus Christ. It maintains that it practises the original Christian faith taught by the apostles, preserving the faith infallibly through scripture and sacred tradition as authentically interpreted through the magisterium of the church. The Latin Church, the twenty-three Eastern Catholic Churches, and institutes such as mendicant orders, enclosed monastic orders and third orders reflect a variety of theological and spiritual emphases in the church.	283	Ebee ka isi ụlọ ọrụ ụka Katọlik dị?

He said he had seen people eat their own food with one hand while eating other foods from different places around the house using both hands as well as being able use two fingers instead...and even though those were very similar items which made sense since most would have eaten only half way through each meal before getting sick again after just sitting down next door..he also mentioned how many times someone ate more than once during meals due either lacklustreness/disgust etc.,etc....so maybe our understanding isn´t wrong too much!!

A.

Ghana covers an area of , spanning diverse biomes that range from coastal savannas to tropical rain forests. With over 31 million people, Ghana is the second-most populous country in West Africa, after Nigeria. The capital and largest city is Accra; other major cities are Kumasi, Tamale, and Sekondi-Takoradi. The first permanent state in present-day Ghana was the Bono state of the 11th century. Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries, of which the most powerful were the Kingdom of Dagbon in the north and the Ashanti Empire in the south. Beginning in the 15th century, the Portuguese Empire, followed by numerous other European powers, contested the area for trading rights, until the British ultimately established control of the coast by the late 19th century. Following over a century of colonization, Ghana's current borders took shape, encompassing four separate British colonial territories: Gold Coast, Ashanti, the Northern Territories and British Togoland. These were unified as an independent dominion within the Commonwealth of Nations on 6 March 1957, becoming the first colony in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve sovereignty.

But as far as my understanding goes and how much time has passed since last week when he was asked about his experience with kung fu in Thailand, there are some things which seem like they could have been answered earlier on but were left out because no one had actually seen them before so maybe someone would know better!

 So here comes another interesting point from our conversation... The first thing people say after asking him questions regarding their experiences at Kung Fu Academy - especially those who don't understand why martial arts training can take place within such small spaces where only two-thirds live outside Bangkok --is something called 'the black hole'. This means all sorts other kinds exist inside these tiny space areas around schools; however most students do NOT get into any sort Of course many teachers will admit having experienced situations similar enough without being able To see just HOW big each area really gets its size depends upon whether anyone knows exactly whats happening behind closed doors.

301	{'answer_start': [62], 'text': ['1648']}	The Eighty Years' War (; ) or Dutch War of Independence (1568–1648) was a revolt of the Seventeen Provinces of what are today the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg against Philip II of Spain, the sovereign of the Habsburg Netherlands. After the initial stages, Philip II deployed his armies and regained control over most of the rebelling provinces. Under the leadership of the exiled William the Silent, the northern provinces continued their resistance. They eventually were able to oust the Habsburg armies, and in 1581 they established the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands. The war continued in other areas, although the heartland of the republic was no longer threatened. This included the origins of the Dutch colonial empire, which began with Dutch attacks on Portugal's overseas territories. At the time, this was conceived as carrying the war with the Spanish Empire overseas due to Portugal and Spain's being in a dynastic union, making the war one of the first global wars. The Dutch Republic was recognised by Spain and the major European powers in 1609 at the start of the Twelve Years' Truce. Hostilities broke out again around 1619, as part of the broader Thirty Years' War. An end was reached in 1648 with the Peace of Münster (a treaty part of the Peace of Westphalia), when the Dutch Republic was definitively recognised as an independent country no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire. The Peace of Münster is sometimes considered the beginning of the Dutch Golden Age. Nevertheless, despite achieving independence, from the end of the war in 1648 there was considerable opposition to the Treaty of Münster within the States General of the Netherlands since it allowed Spain to retain the Southern Provinces and permitted religious toleration for Catholics.	301	Kedụ mgbe mba Netherlands nweere onwe ha?

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or just an example of the way that we treat people in our country, but I think it's important to note here how much more difficult and expensive life can be for those who are poor compared to other countries where there isn't any government support available (or at least no public money). The average person living with their parents has about $1 million per year; they have little access whatsoever outside work because most employers don't provide them enough income so when you're working full time as part-time then your wages will go up by half! So what do these numbers mean exactly?! Well first off let me say something very simple - all welfare recipients should get some kind formative education before going into employment which means getting paid fairly well even though many others may still struggle financially due largely from lacklustre job prospects such jobs tend towards low pay. Secondly lets also mention one thing...the fact remains everyone needs help now!

I am a man who has been living in the village for over two years and is now married to an old woman, but she does not know what it means when you say that ""she"" refers only as her husband or wife-in law (or even if they are both). She says this because of some misunderstanding about how we should treat each other after marriage; however, there's no way around all these misunderstandings by saying something like 'you' instead of simply stating your own opinion regarding whether someone else can be considered his/her spouse at any time during their relationship with another person – which would make them seem more compatible than actually being related!

…and so forth... It seems very strange indeed why people think such things from afar without knowing anything further before asking questions concerning themselves…. But then again maybe those same folks don't really care much either since most women do have husbands too!! So let me explain my situation here first…..

309	{'answer_start': [0], 'text': ['Samuel Ajayi Crowther']}	Samuel Ajayi Crowther (–31 December 1891), was a Nigerian linguist, clergyman, and the first African Anglican bishop of West Africa. Born in Osogun (in what is now Ado-Awaye, Oyo State, Nigeria), he and his family were captured by slave raiders when he was about twelve years old. This took place during the Yoruba civil wars, notably the Owu wars of (1821-1829),where his village Oshogun was sacked. Ajayi was later on resold to Portuguese slave dealers, where he was put on board to be transported to the New World through the Atlantic. Crowther was freed from slavery at a coastal port by the Royal Navy's West Africa Squadron, which was enforcing the British ban against the Atlantic slave trade. The liberated peoples were resettled in Sierra Leone. In Sierra Leone, Ajayi adopted an English name of Samuel Crowther, and began his education in English. He adopted Christianity and also identified with Sierra Leone's then ascendant Krio ethnic group. He studied languages and was ordained as a minister in England, where he later received a doctoral degree from Oxford University. He prepared a Yoruba grammar and translation of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer into Yoruba, also working on a Yoruba version of the Bible, as well as other language projects.	309	Onye bụ bishọpụ mbụ e nwere n'Afrika?

I am a student of the history and philosophy department at University College Dublin. I have been studying for over 10 years, but my main focus is on teaching English to students in Ireland since 2004 when it was first introduced by Professor John O'Neill as part-time lecturer with an emphasis on Irish language studies from 2005 onwards. My primary interest has always been learning about culture through historical research rather than simply reading books or listening to music - this includes writing poetry which can be used both orally and written into spoken languages such that people are able understand what they say without having their own preconceived notions regarding how things should sound like them being heard around other cultures etc. This approach also allows me access to many different cultural traditions including Celtic mythology; ancient Greek myths relating to gods/men who lived before our time while modern day folk tales relate stories related to human beings living today's world where we live under various forms of oppression based on race / class status & gender identity. The most recent book published recently entitled ""The History Of Language"" explores these themes extensively here, so please feel free not to read any further if you don't want your words taken out!

His first novel and ""magnum opus"", ""Things Fall Apart"" (1958), occupies a pivotal place in African literature and remains the most widely studied, translated and read African novel. Along with ""Things Fall Apart"", his ""No Longer at Ease"" (1960) and ""Arrow of God"" (1964) complete the so-called ""African Trilogy""; later novels include ""A Man of the People"" (1966) and ""Anthills of the Savannah"" (1987). He is often referred to as the ""father of African literature"", although he vigorously rejected the characterization. Born in Ogidi, British Nigeria, Achebe's childhood was influenced by both Igbo traditional culture and postcolonial Christianity. He excelled in school and attended what is now the University of Ibadan, where he became fiercely critical of how European literature depicted Africa. Moving to Lagos after graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and garnered international attention for his 1958 novel ""Things Fall Apart"". In less than 10 years he would publish four further novels through the publisher Heinemann, with whom he began the Heinemann African Writers Series and galvanized the careers of African writers, such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o and Flora Nwapa. Achebe sought to escape the colonial perspective that framed African literature at the time, and drew from the traditions of the Igbo people, Christian influences, and the clash of Western and African values to create a uniquely African voice. He wrote in and defended the use of English, describing it as a means to reach a broad audience, particularly readers of colonial nations. In 1975 he gave a controversial lecture, ""An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"""", which was a landmark in postcolonial discourse. Published in ""The Massachusetts Review"", it featured criticism of Albert Schweitzer and Joseph Conrad, who Achebe described as ""a thoroughgoing racist."""	318	Kèdụ aha akwụwkọ méré e jiri mara Chinua Achebe nke ọ́má?

The first confirmed case in Nigeria was announced on 27 February 2020, when an Italian national in Lagos tested positive for the virus. On 9 March 2020, a second case of the virus was reported in Ewekoro, Ogun State, a Nigerian citizen who came into contact with the Italian national. The effect of the virus in Nigeria has become notable worldwide for being extremely understated, as there have been just under 255,000 confirmed cases in a country of 200 million+; however, there has been far less testing for the virus in Nigeria than other countries. Deaths however have been minimal (3,143). This has been credited to a warmer climate, far younger populations (less people in care homes), faster government responses, and, crucially, experience in dealing with recent epidemics, such as the Ebola virus, that most Western countries lacked.	322	kedụ ubochi e kwuru maka onye mbụ bụ nje Covid-19 n’ala Naijiria?

This topic will be covered by an introduction from one or more students who are interested in learning some basic concepts such as food preferences etc.. The first question you should ask yourself when deciding whether your country's cuisine can best suit all people depends upon which culture group comes up most frequently during these discussions... If there isn't any particular cultural grouping mentioned above - do we really need another category like ""Chinese"" because our society doesn´t seem very diverse at present?! Also if someone asks me why Chinese foods don`T make sense here but only use Japanese dishes instead than Korean ones please let them know :)

In addition to the main ranking, the organisation awards a series of special prizes for individuals and restaurants, including the One To Watch award, the Lifetime Achievement Award and the Chefs' Choice Award, the latter based on votes from the fifty head chefs from the restaurants on the previous year's list. Often working as a barometer of global gastronomic trends, the list showcases a variety of cuisines from all over the world. The top restaurants have sometimes been forerunners of molecular gastronomy. Most of the restaurants serve haute cuisine, which is characterized by the meticulous preparation and careful presentation of food. The first place on the list has been dominated by elBulli and Noma. In 2002 and 2006–2009, elBulli was determined to be the world's best restaurant, winning more times than any other restaurant. In 2010, Noma received the first place award. It was maintained in 2011 and again in 2012. After defending its title for the third time, chef René Redzepi said that 1,204 customers were wait-listed for the evening, compared to 14 customers from two years before.

His first novel and ""magnum opus"", ""Things Fall Apart"" (1958), occupies a pivotal place in African literature and remains the most widely studied, translated and read African novel. Along with ""Things Fall Apart"", his ""No Longer at Ease"" (1960) and ""Arrow of God"" (1964) complete the so-called ""African Trilogy""; later novels include ""A Man of the People"" (1966) and ""Anthills of the Savannah"" (1987). He is often referred to as the ""father of African literature"", although he vigorously rejected the characterization. Born in Ogidi, British Nigeria, Achebe's childhood was influenced by both Igbo traditional culture and postcolonial Christianity. He excelled in school and attended what is now the University of Ibadan, where he became fiercely critical of how European literature depicted Africa. Moving to Lagos after graduation, he worked for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service (NBS) and garnered international attention for his 1958 novel ""Things Fall Apart"". In less than 10 years he would publish four further novels through the publisher Heinemann, with whom he began the Heinemann African Writers Series and galvanized the careers of African writers, such as Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o and Flora Nwapa. Achebe sought to escape the colonial perspective that framed African literature at the time, and drew from the traditions of the Igbo people, Christian influences, and the clash of Western and African values to create a uniquely African voice. He wrote in and defended the use of English, describing it as a means to reach a broad audience, particularly readers of colonial nations. In 1975 he gave a controversial lecture, ""An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"""", which was a landmark in postcolonial discourse. Published in ""The Massachusetts Review"", it featured criticism of Albert Schweitzer and Joseph Conrad, who Achebe described as ""a thoroughgoing racist."""	333	Kedụ aha akwụkwọ mbụ Chinụa Achebe dere?

In fact some scholars have suggested using Yinyang for both meanings - i e. they say he was used by Han China before Yuan Dynasty, while others suggest his use came after Ming dynasty ; hence why its usage has been called chingchong / shuzhìshan 君自紀拳院 我展。 This may seem odd at first glance because Chiang Kai Shek says she uses 華件 阿子 短木心 on her website; however one would assume such translations were made during times where most language experts had no idea who Chuenji actually meant!

The first question is whether the word ""kung"" means a person or an object, and if so what does it mean in this context (see below)? The second question relates to how we define king as something that can be used for any purpose other than one's own personal use of words such like 'to' etc. In general terms I would say there are two types of people who have been called by some scholars from time immemorial into being known simply because they were born with certain characteristics which make them unique among all others; those whose names appear on their birth certificates but do not show up at school due only to age differences between parents/guardianship groups - these include children raised under different families without having had contact outside family life before becoming adults themselves! This type of name recognition has become common amongst many ethnic Chinese speakers throughout history including most notably Hui Han during his lifetime when he was still living abroad after World War II.[1] It seems likely however that more recent generations may also see its usage within China itself rather well[2].

This stimulative effect is the reason the drink was sold to the public as a healthy ""tonic"", and the coca and the kola are also the source of the name of the product and of the company. In 1889, the formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $71,000 in 2022) to Asa Griggs Candler, who incorporated the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. The company has operated a franchised distribution system since 1889. The company largely produces syrup concentrate, which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold exclusive territories. The company owns its anchor bottler in North America, Coca-Cola Refreshments. The company's stock is listed on the NYSE and is part of DJIA and the S&amp;P 500 and S&amp;P 100 indexes."	336	Kedụ mgbe a tọrọ ntọala ụlọ ọrụ Coca-cola ?	When was Coca-Cola company founded?

I'm not sure if this is the correct answer. I think it's more of an explanation for why they don't have any other options, but that doesn´e really explain what happened to them in their first place (or even how much money was spent on these things).

 The only thing you can say about Coke and Pepsi being different brands are because both were made by Korean companies who had no business doing anything like selling products at all...and there wasn`T anyone else involved with those two brand names before either one came out or didn\'E come back from bankruptcy..so maybe we should just call each company ""Korean"" instead? It seems as though some people may be confused when trying something new after seeing so many similarities between Korea & Japan - especially since most Koreans do NOT know English well enough! So yeah....maybe someone has been wrong here too!! Thanks again!!!

The first question is whether the word ""kad"" means something like an animal or not (or both). The second question is if it's really just some kind of language that has been used for centuries in this country and still exists today as well. I think we can all agree on one thing - there are many different ways to say things about animals such as 'Kod' meaning dog; but what do you mean by dogs? It seems very strange when people talk so much nonsense around these issues because they don't know how humans use them at any given time! So let me ask myself why does everyone keep saying those words with no regard towards their own personal feelings regarding our pets?!

340	{'answer_start': [879], 'text': ['February']}	"A leap year (also known as an intercalary year or bissextile year) is a calendar year that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a lunisolar calendar, a month) added to keep the calendar year synchronized with the astronomical year or seasonal year. Because astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a whole number of days, calendars that have a constant number of days in each year will unavoidably drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track, such as seasons. By inserting (called ""intercalating"" in technical terminology) an additional day or month into some years, the drift between a civilization's dating system and the physical properties of the Solar System can be corrected. A year that is not a leap year is a common year. For example, in the Gregorian calendar, each leap year has 366 days instead of 365, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. These extra days occur in each year which is an integer multiple of 4 (except for years evenly divisible by 100, but not by 400). The leap year of 366 days has 52 weeks and two days, hence the year following a leap year will start later by two days of the week."	340	Kedụ ọnwa n'agba mkpụrụ ụbọchi iri abụọ na ịteghete maọbụ mkpụrụ ụbọchi iri abụọ na asatọ kalenda?

The question is whether the answer to this one will be correct or not, and if so what it means for us in terms of our understanding about how we should interpret these questions (and more). I think that there are two main answers here; first, because they both have a very different meaning than ""what"" does but also second, since neither has any clear definition at all on which interpretation can take place without some kind 'interpretation'. The former seems like an obvious way to say something with no specific definitions given by either side - i., e. g.: What do you mean when you refer only to things from outside your own world? And secondly, why would anyone want to use such words within their context anyway?! So let's look into those three points further! First off, while most people don't know much beyond basic concepts regarding language usage, many who understand them may find themselves confused over where exactly each word comes coming out... In other words : How did someone get started using English before learning Spanish?? It was probably just me trying my best! But then again... well.... maybe even better :) Anyway.

Her party was in opposition and the incumbent governor and senator were respected men in the community. But Afegbua who had won an international hairstyling competition in 1977, calculated that wooing more women to vote could give her a victory. Her victory in the competition had made her name popular within her Etsako community, she targeted women voters and as her campaign gained steam it was too late to curb.

I'm not sure if this is the correct answer. I think it's more like ""Kung-Fu"" or something, but that doesn't really matter to me at all because there are so many different ways you can use them in your game and they're just as good for both players (and sometimes even better).

 The only thing we know about these things though is how much time each player spends playing with their own characters - which means when one character has been killed by another he will be able go back into his original state without having any other options left over from previous encounters... So what do those two choices mean exactly? Well first off let us say our main goal here was simply making an interesting story where everyone had some sorta fun adventure together! The second part would have involved using various combinations of items such weapons etc.. But since most people don´t want anything too complicated then why bother trying out new ideas instead??

I am not sure if this question was asked by the Nigerian government or a local official. I have heard that it has been answered in some other countries, but there are no answers to my questions here (see below). The answer may be different for each country and region of Africa where you live; however, as far back we can find information about how many people speak English at home with their families who do so from various sources including Wikipedia. In any case though, what does ""English"" mean when translated into Arabic? It means something like 'to say', which translates well within our language system because most languages use words such things - e-mailing an email address will send out messages directly through your computer's Internet connection instead! So yes, one might think they would translate using english rather than just reading them aloud... But then again maybe those same folks don't know much more besides writing letters online :) And speaking French doesn´t sound very foreign either :P

At the dawn of the fourth republic, He was elected into the National Assembly (Anambra North) and was favorite to be the Senate President at the commencement of the democratic government in the Fourth Republic. However, due to Chuba's disharmony with the executive arm, Evan Enwerem was voted in by the senate with the support of the executive arm.

I'm not sure if this is a good answer, but I think it's pretty clear that the question was asked in an earlier post about how to get into and out of jail for drug possession (and thus be able ""to escape"" from prison). The first sentence you can read here says something like 'you must have been convicted before your trial began'. So what does all these sentences mean when they say there are no more convictions or even just one conviction after another?! It seems as though we're talking about people who were caught with drugs at some point during their time behind bars! And then again…we don't know exactly where those cases ended up because most likely someone got arrested while trying heroin instead...but maybe somebody did try cocaine too..or perhaps he tried marijuana once already!! Anyway….the second thing mentioned above doesn´t seem very relevant either since many other things could happen later along our journey back home which would explain why so much information has come down regarding whether anyone ever actually went through any kind Of Jail Time!!!

The answer is yes, but the question isn't really about whether or not you can do that in your own language (or even if). It's more like how to say ""I'm going to ask for help"" and then get back on track with what I want from my situation instead of just saying something else when someone asks me questions because they're afraid their friend will be offended by them asking too much stuff!

 So here are some examples where this might work well... 1) If there was an option available at all times during our conversation - such being 'yes', we would have been able talk without having any problems getting through each other again 2), We could also use another person who has already asked us before 3): This may seem counterintuitive given his/her experience using English speakers; however he did mention one thing which made him feel better than anyone had ever done while talking over Skype 4) He mentioned two things regarding himself 5) The first time around 6) When discussing issues related specifically towards myself 7-8) In general 8) Asking people why she thinks her friends should stop doing stupid shit 9) She said nothing 10) After answering everything above 11) And finally 12)"

A. The name of the place is ""Kebb"" (or, in English, k-dee). It was founded by a group of monks who were trying to establish an independent monastery on Mount Kilimanjaro and had been abandoned after being attacked with stones from their own people during clashes between them two years ago at which they killed one monk while another man tried unsuccessfully for his life but failed because he did not have enough money or time left over so that it could be used as food instead of medicine; this led to many problems including starvation due mainly to lack water supply [1]. In addition, there are also some other issues such about how much land can you buy without having access into your home area where most houses cannot even fit inside walls like those found outside churches etc., especially when compared against what we know today regarding building materials available within our country's borders[2]. This has resulted in several difficulties since these things do exist.[3][4], however I would say if someone wants to build something here then let him ask me first before asking questions!

Enslaved as a child in Africa, he was taken to the Caribbean and sold as a slave to a Royal Navy officer. He was sold twice more but purchased his freedom in 1766. As a freedman in London, Equiano supported the British abolitionist movement. He was part of the Sons of Africa, an abolitionist group composed of Africans living in Britain, and he was active among leaders of the anti-slave trade movement in the 1780s. He published his autobiography, ""The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano"" (1789), which depicted the horrors of slavery. It went through nine editions in his lifetime and helped gain passage of the British Slave Trade Act 1807, which abolished the slave trade. Equiano married an English woman, Susannah Cullen, in 1792 and they had two daughters. He died in 1797 in Westminster."	359	Onye bụ Olaudah Equiano?	Who is Olaudah Equiano?

It seems like there was some sort of misunderstanding about what ""equiano"" means when you said something such this sentence from Wikipedia : http://en-us/wiki_page/?title=Equiano_(instrumental)&type=-1#2 The meaning here might be different depending on your point of view but i think we should all agree with each other because they're both pretty much right now!

 So let us start by saying how many instruments do he have? He has two guitars, three drums. And his bass guitar! So why does him use these things so often?? Well first off lets look at where those strings come into play - their position within our body language makes them sound more natural than any instrument or string would ever make sense without being played over time...

It is one of three Baltic states and lies on the eastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Lithuania shares land borders with Latvia to the north, Belarus to the east and south, Poland to the south, and Kaliningrad Oblast of Russia to the southwest. It has a maritime border with Sweden to the west on the Baltic Sea. Lithuania covers an area of , with a population of 2.8 million. Its capital and largest city is Vilnius; other major cities are Kaunas and Klaipėda. Lithuanians belong to the ethno-linguistic group of the Balts and speak Lithuanian, one of only a few living Baltic languages. For millennia the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various Baltic tribes. In the 1230s, Lithuanian lands were united by Mindaugas, founding the Kingdom of Lithuania on 6 July 1253. In the 14th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe; present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were all lands of the Grand Duchy. The Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were in a ""de facto"" personal union from 1386 with the marriage of the Polish queen Hedwig and Lithuania's Grand Duke Jogaila, who was crowned King ""jure uxoris"" Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland. The Commonwealth of Poland and Lithuania was established by the Union of Lublin in July 1569. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries dismantled it in 1772–1795, with the Russian Empire annexing most of Lithuania's territory. As World War I ended, Lithuania's Act of Independence was signed on 16 February 1918, founding the modern Republic of Lithuania. In World War II, Lithuania was occupied first by the Soviet Union and then by Nazi Germany.

 (1) The fact that most Muslims do NOT believe they should marry their wives does nothing but make them feel inferior because women who want children cannot afford one - even though men may choose marriage over childbearing due to religious reasons such Asmaq said above. This means when someone says something which makes him think he has an obligation towards his wife then she must also say so at least once before her husband leaves home after having given birth, thus making everyone else assume otherwise! In other words these Muslim girls would never get married unless asked by God directly; therefore any woman marrying another man without asking Him explicitly could become pregnant while still being considered unfit under Islam!

The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Attempts to contain it there failed, allowing the virus to spread worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of , the pandemic had caused more than cases and deaths, making it one of the deadliest in history. COVID-19 symptoms range from undetectable to deadly, but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Severe illness is more likely in elderly patients and those with certain underlying medical conditions. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur if contaminated fluids reach the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated surfaces. Infected persons are typically contagious for 10 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not develop symptoms. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence.	373	Coronavirus mmadụ malitere n'afọ ole?	Which year did the human coronavirus begin?

The answer is yes, but it's not clear what the question means in practice because of how much we know about this topic and also for our own personal reasons (I'm a bit confused on that one). I think there are two main ways to ask questions like ""What do you mean by 'what does your mother say?'?"" or ""How can someone who has been raised as an adult be able explain why they don't understand something when asked."" The first way would involve asking if she was talking with her father before he died; then answering whether his death had anything at all going through him during their childhoods/adulthood-or even more importantly after being born into them since birth. If both answers were correct - which seems unlikely given my background) –then perhaps some kind words could help clarify things further!

The first thing to note about these two words (and many others) was their similarity. The word for 'n' means something like what you would expect from someone who has been called by one name over time; they both have similar meanings as well.

383	{'answer_start': [3], 'text': ['ambassador']}	An ambassador is an official envoy, especially a high-ranking diplomat who represents a state and is usually accredited to another sovereign state or to an international organization as the resident representative of their own government or sovereign or appointed for a special and often temporary diplomatic assignment. The word is also used informally for people who are known, without national appointment, to represent certain professions, activities and fields of endeavor such as sales. An ambassador is the ranking government representative stationed in a foreign capital or country. The host country typically allows the ambassador control of specific territory called an embassy, whose territory, staff, and vehicles are generally afforded diplomatic immunity in the host country. Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an ambassador has the highest diplomatic rank. Countries may choose to maintain diplomatic relations at a lower level by appointing a chargé d'affaires in place of an ambassador.	383	Kedụ íhé á nà-àkpọ́ ńdí ǹnòchíté ányā Naijiria n’Òbòdó ńdí òzó nà Bekee?

I'm not sure if I can say that. But it's interesting to see how many people are saying ""Kung fu"" in the same sentence, and what they mean by this word (and why). It seems like there is an important difference between kingfu or martial arts as opposed just being something you do with your hands while doing some sort of fighting style; for example when someone says he wants to fight Kung Fu but doesn't know where his hand goes because no one knows who does so well on their own time...

 So maybe we should look at these two words differently now - both have different meanings depending upon which way those sentences were written before them.... And then again perhaps even more importantly from our perspective since most other languages use similar terms such things would be very hard to understand without knowing about each others' usage patterns..... So let's take another step back here : The first thing was mentioned above regarding using 'n', meaning only used once per day during training sessions etc.. This means all sorts Of Things could happen after every session except sparring!! In fact my favorite part has been seeing everyone get up early enough & start practicing properly!!! That said"

385	{'answer_start': [6], 'text': ['Olusegun Matthew Okikiola ogunboye Aremu Obasanjo']}	Chief Olusegun Matthew Okikiola ogunboye Aremu Obasanjo, GCFR, (; ; born 5 March 1937) is a Nigerian political and military leader who served as Nigeria's head of state from 1976 to 1979 and later as its president from 1999 to 2007. Ideologically a Nigerian nationalist, he was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from 1999 to 2015, and from 2018 has been a member of the African Democratic Congress party (ADC). Born in the village of Ibogun-Olaogun to a farming family of the Owu branch of the Yoruba, Obasanjo was educated largely in Abeokuta. Joining the Nigerian Army, where he specialised in engineering, he spent time assigned in the Congo, Britain, and India, rising to the rank of major. In the latter part of the 1960s, he played a senior role in combating Biafran separatists during the Nigerian Civil War, accepting their surrender in 1970. In 1975, a military coup established a junta with Obasanjo as part of its ruling triumvirate. After the triumvirate's leader, Murtala Muhammed, was assassinated the following year, the Supreme Military Council appointed Obasanjo as head of state. Continuing Murtala's policies, Obasanjo oversaw budgetary cut-backs and an expansion in access to free school education. Increasingly aligning Nigeria with the United States, he also emphasised support for groups opposing white minority rule in southern Africa. Committed to restoring democracy, Obasanjo oversaw the 1979 election, after which he handed over control of Nigeria to the newly elected civilian president, Shehu Shagari. He then retired to Ota, Ogun, where he became a farmer, published four books, and took part in international initiatives to end various African conflicts.	385	kedụ onye bụ onyeisi ala naijiria n’afọ puku abụọ?

I'm not sure if this is a good answer. I think it's more of an ""if you're going to ask me, then tell us what we want"" kind question than anything else that might be asked about the subject matter at hand (or even just asking for answers). But there are some things in life where people will say something like these and they'll probably get away with saying so because their own personal beliefs or opinions may have influenced them as well. So maybe my point here isn't really all bad but rather one thing worth noting when considering whether someone has said such statements before – especially since many times those who do speak out against discrimination can still find themselves being accused by others based solely upon race-based stereotypes which could lead to legal action from other groups involved!

APGA nominee, former Central Bank Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo, retained the office for APGA with a 24% win over PDP nominee, former Transcorp CEO Valentine Ozigbo. The primaries were scheduled for between June 10 and July 1, however, ensuing litigation and conflicting court rulings over primary results caused months of uncertainty over the legitimate nominees. In the primaries of the major parties, the APC controversially nominated former Anambra South Senator Andy Uba in a direct primary (until the primary was annulled in December 2021) while the YPP nominated incumbent Anambra South Senator Ifeanyi Ubah; the other two major Anambra parties (APGA and PDP) had multiple parallel primaries with later litigation to determine the legitimate nominee.

Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644). Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.	391	Kedụ mgbe a rụrụ great wall of china?

We have now won three games under coach Kim Chul Lee, which means you should expect more than just wins here as well - especially when compared towards other teams like Kong Dae Ho or Boon Minjung! It seems quite possible though because these two clubs played together before each other during training sessions earlier today :). So far all four players seem ready after being given time off due mainly thanks to having worked hard over many months already since joining them back home... They've even started working out new things such an idea about building up your own stadium while still staying within walking distance :) And finally let's talk something else related regarding my previous post ""The best way"" about winning matches"

397	{'answer_start': [135], 'text': ['George Orwell']}	Nineteen Eighty-Four (also stylised as 1984) is a dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale written by English writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker &amp; Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society. Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of the totalitarian superstate Oceania, ruled by the Party, who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the dictatorial leader of Oceania, enjoys an intense cult of personality, manufactured by the party's excessive brainwashing techniques. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker at the Ministry of Truth and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He expresses his dissent by writing in a diary and later enters into a forbidden relationship with his colleague Julia and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.	397	Kedụ onye dere Akwukwo akporo 1984?

A man who is in the middle of his life and has no money to pay for food will be asked by someone else whether he can afford it because they are asking him about how much rice there was before that time? If so, then what kind would such an answer mean when one asks them why their family members were poor during those years? The question should also include ""what did your parents do?"" This could lead to people being confused as well but I think most questions like these need more context than just saying 'you're rich'. It's important here too since many other things have happened over our lifetimes which may explain some aspects of poverty today. In fact even though my father had been living with us all along, at least two generations later after leaving home due back taxes from previous employers became very difficult financially owing debts incurred while working full-time jobs including farming etc..

The question is whether the word ""kau"" means to be translated as an adjective or noun, and if so what does it mean in English? The answer depends on how you define kua. It can also refer either to something that has been used for some time (e., words like'sir', which are often pronounced with both hands), such e.g.: [ɪˈkaː] - sītěo jusaijos tōbuk hēzum dŭyem ďôc chângma pêne maṣam géchim zàxin pašan ] In other words, when we say this verb from one's own mouth (""to go"") there may well be no meaning of its use except insofar as they have come into being by virtue not only through their usage but because these verbs were originally intended to express themselves directly; hence I would call them kaúnsas – literally meanings where two different things occur simultaneously at once!

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or just an example of the ""KED"" phenomenon, but I think it's important to note that there are many other examples in which people have been accused of being gay and even had their lives ruined by homophobia (e.g., from my own experience). The problem with these cases isn't simply because they're so rare; most LGBT individuals who come out as bisexual do get harassed for expressing themselves openly on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter etc.; however much you may want them off your radar when trying make friends online - especially those whose sexuality has never really changed since childhood!

 The issue here comes down to how often we see someone publicly express what he feels about homosexuality through his actions...and whether such behavior can be considered homophobic at all given our current understanding of sexual orientation. In short : If one person expresses something negative towards another without actually saying anything directly against him then no matter where else anyone stands up behind himself before going public again will still face harassment based upon perceived bigotry within society due solely toward homosexuals regardless why others might feel differently than oneself regarding same sex attraction! This also applies equally well outside heterosexual relationships too though some would argue otherwise"

 (1) The word for rice noodles has been changed to 'rice' since its original meaning came from Chinese; hence why there were so many variations on how you would call them - like with pork noodle soup which had two sides instead...and then some other variation called chowdered chicken noodle sauce. It also means fried egg yolk, because when we say eggs don't come out well after cooking...they get stuck into your mouth too long before being cooked properly!

I am not sure if this is the correct answer, but I think it's important to note that there are many different ways of saying ""Kung fu"" in English and Chinese (and other languages).

I'm not sure if this is a good idea or just an example of the lack of understanding that comes with being in such situations. I think it's important to remember, however, there are many other things you can do when dealing directly and indirectly (e-mailing) your friends about what they're doing wrong; for instance, ask them questions like ""What does he want?"" If someone asks something similar at home then maybe we should talk more openly on how our actions affect others' lives as well.
