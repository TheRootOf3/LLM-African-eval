Leader’s Office Urges Iranians to Aid People of Somalia - Khamenei.ir  Following the drought crisis and famine in the Horn of Africa, particularly in Somalia, the Leader's office issued a statement calling on all Iranians to aid the famine-stricken people of Somalia."	" The President said that he was ""deeply concerned"" about what happened during this time period but added: We are not going anywhere."" He also called for Iran (and other countries) who have been supporting al Qaeda terrorists against their own citizens to be held accountable by international law as well. In his speech at Tehran University last week, Rouhani spoke out strongly regarding Iranian support for terrorist groups such Asad Al Nusra Front or Ahrar ash Sham which has carried extremist messages including suicide bombings targeting civilians with explosives. According To Tasnim News Agency, an official from Ahmadinejad's administration told reporters : I am deeply worried over these attacks because they threaten our country...I think it is very important we do everything possible so there can no longer continue terrorism like today"". On Friday morning after meeting Prime Minister Hassan Rohani earlier yesterday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Javadekar confirmed reports saying US Secretary General John Kerry had met him personally before heading off into Saudi Arabia where talks were expected later tonight between representatives representing both sides' governments concerning Syria peace negotiations.. Speaking ahead Of course if any foreign government wants its embassy staff back then why should anyone else? It seems clear now how much pressure will go around when one side gets involved again! This latest incident comes just days away from another attack"

The full text of the statement is as follows:"	" ""I am a man who has been born in Japan, and I have lived here for over twenty years."" The Japanese word meaning'man' means that he was raised by his parents (or grandparents) at home or abroad; it's also used with respect towards women because they are considered more important than men when looking after their children.[1] In other words if your child doesn´t speak any language then there will be no way out from this situation without speaking some formative foreign tongue which can help them understand what happened on Earth before being able talk about things outside of normal life situations such like schoolwork etc. This would mean having an interpreter available so people could learn how to communicate properly between different cultures while still maintaining good communication skills among themselves! It should not take much effort but just remember these two points first – do NOT use translators unless absolutely necessary!![2][3].

 (The following is a translation made with permission.)  I am going through this verse because I want people reading it as well so we can understand what was meant here... It says ""Allah has given us an inheritance which will enable our descendants after generations to live on"". So if someone reads something like 'the Quran gives birth to two sons', then there must also mean one son inheriting both parents'. This means when your father dies or becomes ill - even though no child ever gets married out-of wedlock! And how does anyone get pregnant? Well let me explain why my wife got divorced first.... She had been living at home but she didn´t go back into work till her husband died due cause.. Then suddenly came news about some strange thing happening around 2am..and now i'm thinking maybe its just another day since im gone off working lol. But wait, did u read anything else? No way!! What happened next?? My mother went missing while visiting relatives....."

" The situation is so dire that it has become a national crisis for many countries around the world as well; this year alone more than 1 million Somali refugees have fled their homes due largely because of lack or desperation by some governments on both sides (see ""The Refugee Crisis: How Many Somalis Are In Need Of Help?""). This humanitarian catastrophe will continue until at least 2040 when we can expect an even greater number who want help from other nations but do not yet understand how they could be helped if there was no aid available today!

The following are some examples from this year in which prayers were allowed during Ramadan (1st July): 1) A person who was praying at night when he had no other means than his own hands; 2), An elderly man with an open mouth while wearing clothes made out like cloth covered with paper towels 3).

By their nature human beings, require and are eager to worship God and to show humility before Him, God who is the Creator of all goodness and beauties. And prayer fulfills this need."	" The word ""prayer"" means that it does not mean a single thing but rather an infinite number of things which can be done in one day or another by any person with knowledge about them; for example: Prayer may help us understand our own needs as well (for instance) when we pray at home because there will always be something better than what I have already prayed on my way back from work so far away! It also helps me remember how much time has passed since last night's meal while praying without having had enough sleep yet again... This kind 'prayer' should never come into use unless someone else gives its name - if they do then let your mind wander off thinking nothing more concerning yourself until after dinner comes around tomorrow morning :)

 The following words were used during translation : ㅠ(1-2), 아시리 마이다, 受과하행   [I am going out]. In other words these two phrases could refer either directly to each others feelings towards oneself/self etc.. But here was some context added where both meanings would appear together:- 1 ) A man might feel ashamed over his actions being taken against him due solely to personal"

By making prayers obligatory, divine religions quench the thirst of human nature and save it from confusion and misguidance concerning the quenching of this thirst."	" The prayer is a means by which we can attain salvation through faith in God's Word (cf. 1 Cor 11:9). It also serves as an instrument for spiritual growth; therefore I would like your attention here on how many times people have prayed that they are going out into heaven with their souls bound up together so tightly around Christ Jesus who has been raised above all things according his own will. This was done at St. Peter Cathedral where he had received His Body before He died, but now there were no more than two or three thousand pilgrims praying about Him every day during Lent when those same priests did not even pray regularly enough because these days most churches do nothing else except offer sacrifices after Masses while others keep silent until Sunday morning hours just waiting patiently awaiting Communion without any sign whatsoever indicating what time each one should be ready! In fact some Catholic Churches still refuse to give communion if someone asks them why ""they"" want to hear such words spoken aloud instead of being able either directly ask questions themselves regarding whether something really happened today then answer honestly rather quickly since Catholics often believe everything written down orally must mean anything other Than What They Say! So let us take another example... Let me tell my story first - When Pope John Paul II visited Rome last year alone wearing white"

When divine remembrance, prayers and worship combine with the fabric of social life, they reveal the miracle of Islam in the constellation of divine commands."	" The Quran is a book that reveals this miraculous truth through its many verses: ""The Messenger (peace be upon him) said 'I am Allah's messenger.' And I was saying it when he asked me if there were any other prophets besides Him."" This verse tells us about God who created all things by His own hand; He made man from nothing but his Creator as well so we can understand how our world works today! It also explains why Muhammad believed what others believe because these are true truths which have been revealed for centuries now - namely...the Qur'an has no need or authority over anyone else except those Who Know Its Truths. We must not forget just one thing here : Our religion teaches people everything possible without exception! In fact, even though some Muslims do practice their faith on an individual basis like ours does at home ; yet most Muslim women still wear hijab while wearing traditional Islamic clothing such Asiatic ones including headscarves & veils!! So let them learn more than ever before!! Let everyone see where each person comes into contact during Ramadan..and then ask yourself whether your religious beliefs will change after fasting? Or should every single day become less important? What would happen once someone becomes aware of something new happening within themselves?? How could anything possibly go wrong"

 (Source: http://www-news24/english-sentence_1e9f8c4b6d5ec2be7ed3db0cf08) The Muslim community needs better understanding regarding what constitutes ""Islam"" when they are talking about mosques or other religious institutions such Asiatic schools where students can learn Arabic from their teachers while attending school at home? This would help them understand how much time goes into learning something new every day! I am sure many people have heard these words before but if anyone knows anything else please let me hear back so my comments will get added here.

Congregational prayers in the mosque with other believers, is taking part in a divine celebration and this makes the rain of divine mercy heavier and more pleasing."	" The prayer will be held at an altar or on top thereof for one hour before being carried out by another person who has been praying there as well (see above). This means that if someone else does not pray then they are doing it wrong because God wants them here so He can bless their souls! Congregational Prayer: A religious ceremony which takes place during Lent when people gather together under some kind banner from time-to -time until evening after sunset; usually called ""the day"" since its name comes directly afterwards into use throughout history but also used today often due mainly towards Christian holidays such Assemblies etc.. It's important to note however how many times we have heard about these things over our lives... In fact I've seen several instances where Christians were asked why no church was performing any sort 'congregation' like what happened last year.... Well let me tell ya now..... We all remember those days back home just looking around while watching TV & listening music...... And even though most churches do perform congregations every Sunday night, sometimes everyone gets up early enough... So maybe your pastor might want us tonight? Or perhaps he would rather see his congregation get ready than watch something bad happen next week? Let me give my opinion :)

" The prayer is not just for God but also as an expression of his love towards all mankind who are living on earth with him."" (Hussein al-Baghdadi)

""I am praying because I believe there will be no war between us or our enemies until we have reached this point where peace can take place without bloodshed,"" he said during Ramadan at Al Aqsa Mosque near Baghdad city center ""We pray together every day so people understand what they need from each others' hearts when their lives depend on them; if someone does something wrong then everyone should do likewise"". He added: 'If anyone has done anything bad against me my brothers would surely forgive themselves.' In addition to these two statements by Imam Hussein bin Abi Talib about Islam being divided into three parts - Muslim faith, Sunni Islamism & Shia Islamism - many Muslims feel like those things were never mentioned before... They felt such hatred toward Christians after seeing how much Christianity was destroyed under Saddam Hussain. This feeling led some members [of] religious groups including Shiites to call upon Allah Almighty, saying `Allah bless your souls` which means Holy Quran! It seems very strange now since most Islamic scholars agree regarding both religions having been created according To Muhammad ibn Abdallah Ibn Taymiyyah wrote"
15	This is how the mosque should be viewed.	Da irin wannan mahangar ce ya kamata a dinga kallon masallaci.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is how the mosque should be viewed."	" It's not a place where people are going out of their way for religious reasons, but rather because it has been converted into an Islamic institution and its members have become Muslims themselves (and they're all Muslim). The fact that this was done in such haste does nothing more than make Islam look like some sort 'Islamic' religion which doesn´t exist at ALL! This isn�re about being ignorant or trying too hard on your own beliefs; I think we need better understanding from our leaders who understand what really happened here so far...

 I would also suggest reading up upon these facts before making any further comments: 1) There were no mosques built by non-Muslims during World War II - there wasn`e one anywhere near them 2), No Mosque Built During WWII 3/4) In 1945 when Hitler invaded Poland he had his first major military operation against Germany 4) He didn\'d want Jews coming over as refugees 5/) When Nazi troops arrived after WW2 6): They took Jewish prisoners 7)/ After war ended with German surrender 8)) And finally 9)? 10)(In 1946 many Germans came back home 11*) 12)* 13* 14*) 15*) 16*) 17*) 18*) 19 *) 20*) 21*) 22*) 23))) 24)))) 25 ) 26 ))"

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The spirit of the mosque instills dynamism and motivation into the body of life."	" It is a place where people are encouraged not just by their religion but also through prayer, fasting, meditation, etc. The Muslim community has been known for its love towards all those who have sacrificed themselves in service or sacrifice on behalf (i)of Allah; (ii);(iii),and/or (iv). In this way we can see that there was no need at first when it came time-to pray before God's presence as an individual person because our prayers were directed toward Him alone so he could be present with us during his absence from His Presence without any interference whatsoever! This means if someone wants to go out after work then they should do what He says: ""I will come back tomorrow morning."" And I am going home today!"" So why did Muhammad choose such simple words? Because these things happen naturally within Islam which makes them very easy to understand even though some may think otherwise...

 So how does one explain something like 'the Spirit' being used here? Well let me give two examples - One example would show up somewhere along my journey around Mecca. There might well be other places nearby too, especially near mosques! But most importantly : A man named Abu Bakr had gone down upon Medina Road about 10 years ago looking forward over many days trying desperately"

It also says something like:""I am going back home after having spent two days living among strangers before coming across such things....and now seeing nothing more than"

This book provides some interesting insights into how these two traditions were developed over time through different sources including books written during periods such Asiatic times like those between 1400 and 1500 AD which can help us understand why so many people today still believe both traditional practices AND modern ones!! It also gives insight onto where all religions came together under certain circumstances while others did NOT!!!

The Prophet Muhammad was a man who had been born in Medina, but he did not have any knowledge about Islam until after death from disease or illness which caused him great suffering during life-long pilgrimage into Mecca where many people were killed by Muslims as they tried desperately trying their best at converting them back home. He died there without knowing it because no Muslim would ever believe what happened when someone else came along asking if anyone could help convert another person out of this world so easily! The reason why I am writing these words is simple: It's time we all started talking again - let us talk more openly now before making excuses like ""I'm sorry"", etc... We need some kinder way forward than blaming others just yet.. Let me tell ya how much better things are going then today!! And remember those days? When your family members told everyone around you something bad happening while praying together over dinner every night? Well here comes my friend : ) So please do NOT blame yourself!!! You can never forgive yourselves!! But try telling everybody right away! Don´t forget though.. That God has forgiven YOU ALL OF YOUR LIVES AND HE WILL NEVER FORGET IT!!!!!!!!!

 [2][3]. This quote was taken from an article published in Al-Jazeera's Arabic channel on May 24th 2013 which stated : ""[Takfiri said], as he spoke about his own life during Ramadan,that there are two kinds – one for those who believe they have reached paradise through prayer alone; another group whose followers do not pray but instead follow their prophet with devotion"". It also states this verse clearly stating it will take time before people can reach Paradise. In other words if someone does go out into public without praying then I would expect them at least once every three years so we should see how long after these prayers last everyone gets back home safely! So what did Takfa really mean? He meant when Muslims were able achieve peace within themselves while others had no hope because all things considered our lives could never end until Allah gave us freedom!"" - Tafseer al-Muhajirani __________________ Last edited By tahtamil ; 07 Sep 2014 @ 08 00..

""In this context we must not forget that there are many other factors which can be used in order for a state to become an effective one and thus it should always remain so if possible... The most important thing here was how much power could Israel have over its people without any interference from outside or even by force..."" (Rabbi Yitzhak Rabin's speech at his funeral on July 25th 1948). This quote has been quoted numerous times before but I will try to summarize what he said: ""...the Jewish State would never allow itself...to fall into such hands as these.... It does not need help whatsoever; rather than being forced out through violence alone with no means necessary - all efforts made within our borders were futile because they did not involve us having direct control"". In fact when asked about whether she had ever heard him speak during her time working under Hitler then-Prime Minister Ariel Sharon replied:""I do remember saying something like 'We're going nowhere' once again after my first meeting [with President Roosevelt] where Mr Netanyahu told me some things very similar.""""And yet today?""(Sharon, June 24, 1949)""Yes"", says Haaretz correspondent David Ben Gurion who also"

This was not an exaggeration but it did make him sound like he had some kind words about Israel's occupation in his speech at Beirut University on 9 May 1967 which were very similar to those used by Netanyahu during last year's election campaign when they called upon voters who supported them to vote with their feet if there would be no peace between Israelis and Palestinians (see above). In fact many Israeli politicians even went so far as saying Hezbollah should go away from its position because we need more support than ever before after all these years! It seems clear now how much pressure will come into play over what happens next - especially given our current situation where most Palestinian leaders seem determinedly trying desperately hard get rid out of power without any real change or reform whatsoever...

""We are looking at ways to strengthen our relationship as well as strengthening cooperation among countries involved in this issue"".Mr Kheli also stressed that his country is committed towards peace talks after years without an agreement from both sides - which have left many people feeling isolated by their own governments' failure or lacklustre efforts to reach agreements over issues ranging across borders including Syria's civil war.In addition, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah warned against further escalation if it comes into force because there will be no progress toward ending violence within two months.""""If we do nothing then what happens next?

They have been trained by Hezbollah as well as other terrorist groups such a Hamas or Islamic State group that has carried out attacks on Israel since 2006-07 (see ""Hamas: A New Generation""). In addition they also provide support to local authorities who protect their citizens' rights under international law including freedom not be infringed upon without due process; protection over property belonging thereto which may include land owned by private persons but does so subjecting it solely with respect towards public works projects like roads etc.; control over water supplies through an independent authority whose sole responsibility lies elsewhere rather than at home where there can be no accession into power); legalisation via legislation allowing people living outside Beirut statehood status – this includes those residing abroad while being held accountable if found guilty during trial/trial proceedings relating directly related crimes committed before them(including murder) although these offences do not constitute criminal offenses nor should any person convicted thereof face prosecution.(1).

 The following are excerpts taken directly from an article published last year entitled ""A Tale Of Two Cities"" which appeared online under the title ""How To Travel With A Foreign Minister"". It states that when visiting Mecca during Hajj pilgrimage every day since 2000, he had received many messages asking him whether his country could help us travel abroad without having visas issued through foreign authorities. He replied : I am sure your answer depends upon what kind visa holder comes here first; however my question does depend entirely solely around who gets paid according where ; therefore please let me explain why such questions should never come up again! As far back then most foreigners did nothing wrong except ask themselves 'what's going down?'"

Ayatollah Taskhiri was a member of the Iranian delegation which was sent to Saudi Arabia to negotiate with Saudi officials."	" He is now in jail and has been accused by some Saudis for his role as an informant on behalf, among others Iran's ambassador at Riyadh International Airport (RIA Novosti). Ayatsir had previously said that he would not be extradited because ""I am afraid I will lose my job."" The US government did nothing about it until after this story broke last week when they announced their intention never again to prosecute him or any other Iranians who were involved directly in negotiations between Tehran and Washington over its nuclear program. In fact, there are no charges against them yet but if convicted we could face up-to five years behind bars - even though many have already served time under house arrest without trial since 2011. This means our case may well end before then unless Congress passes legislation making sure all Americans can get fair trials based solely upon what happened during those talks... We hope your message helps us understand how important these hearings really should become!

This information was provided by an individual who has been involved with this event since it began on May 1st 2012 at al-'Aqsa Mosque near Mecca. It includes some interesting facts about what happened after 9/11, including details regarding where all those killed were located as well As we have seen before there may be many different interpretations among people living within these areas but one thing I would like everyone to understand here - There must always remain peace between believers & nonbelievers throughout our lives!

In your opinion, what is the philosophy behind these messages?"	" What are they about and why do we need them so much in our daily lives? I think that it's important for us to understand how people communicate with each other through words like ""I love him"" or even more importantly: How can one be able not just express oneself but also feel loved by someone who loves her as well (and has a lot of friends)? It seems obvious from this perspective there must have been some kind relationship between two men when he was young – maybe his father had an affair while she worked at home… But then again if my own parents were married before their marriage ended up being annulled because both parties wanted children together after divorce … So perhaps something deeper than mere friendship could explain all those things! And yet here comes another question which needs answering : Why does anyone want such relationships? The answer lies somewhere within ourselves. We live on many different levels, including social level; personal life ; family dynamics / culture etc. In order towards understanding where most communication occurs among individuals around me personally i would suggest reading books written over time called 'The Art of Communication'! This book explains everything related specifically to communicating verbally using language based upon human emotions rather easily understandable concepts & ideas.. You will find out exactly WHY YOU SHOULD NOT BE CONNECTED WITH"

There are a few points that I should mention before answering this question."	" First, there is no way of knowing if your translation has been changed or not (I'm sure it's possible). Second and most importantly: The word ""translated"" in Japanese means something different than what we would expect from an actual language like Chinese. It doesn´t mean anything new; rather, its meaning changes depending on how much time passes between words being spoken at once - so for example when someone says 'you can speak' they will be speaking about their own voice instead! So even though some people may think these translations have nothing whatsoever going with them as far back into history, many others still believe those who use such phrases do indeed understand why certain things were said by other speakers during times where speech was more common then today! And finally, while translating one phrase might seem strange now because all languages change over years but just remember...it happened very recently :-P

First of all, hajj â€“ which is an Islamic obligation â€“ pursues great goals."	" It's a way for people who are not religious or have no religion in their lives to be able communicate with one another and get along without being afraid that they will lose everything if someone tries to kill them (or even just try to hurt themselves). The goal here isn´t necessarily ""kill"" anyone but it can help others by giving some kind words about what happens when we do something wrong so asnotto harm ourselves while doing this work:

The first thing I want everyone else does right now would be like how many times did your father die? How often was he killed because his family didn�d care enough?"" This means there should be more than 1 person involved at any given time - especially those whose parents were murdered before him! So let us take our own example from Islam where every Muslim has been asked why Muslims aren`T allowed to marry women outside marriage due taqiyya  (marriage between two men). In fact most religions forbid such marriages since Allah says : """"And whoever divorces himself shall divorce none other man except Him."" And then He said: وَصِيْتُوا أن يسلم العربة مداده [الیک"
45	Based on the Holy Quran, maybe the biggest goal of hajj is the connection between the Islamic Ummah and the activities of the prophets throughout history. That is to say, according to Sura al-Baqara, it began with the creation of Adam and Eve when angels prostrated in front of them, their experiences in paradise, their banishment to earth and finally their use of their heavenly experiences, including committing sins, repenting and complete submission to divine commands.

" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: ""The first thing that I did was as a child."" Then he went out into his house for prayer; then came back again after having prayed all night long until morning at which point they were brought up by Allah's Messenger Muhammad who told us about this event from time immemorial so we could understand what had happened during our lifetime! This story has been narrated many times before but never once have there been any mention or reference made regarding how these events took place prior either through revelation nor even direct experience alone - just an anecdote based off some sort 'experience' given orally over several years ago...

49	The second goal has also been mentioned: making human beings go back to their nature and to the natural path of surrendering to God. And this goal is manifested in all rituals of hajj.

" The third objective for us here are those who have not yet reached that stage where they can become a true believer or an authentic Muslim (i) but still want to be part-time Muslims as well as nonbelievers; we do so because our hearts desire freedom from oppression by others while at the same time seeking peace through prayer with Allah Almighty.""

We need more than just religious education - if someone wants to join me he must learn how to read Quran properly before joining my group"". He added that his own family had already joined him when she became pregnant after her father died during childbirth due 'to lacklustre health'. She told Al Jazeera about having no children since birth which led to difficulties getting married later upon marriage.[1][2].

In fact it says something like what follows when someone asks him if they can do anything with their life except pray on his behalf?

So why did Muhammad give such an answer!? Why didn`t Islam allow people living under Sharia law access to prayer during Ramadan?? What happened here??? When Muslims were asked questions regarding religion before entering Mecca - which had already become very popular among Muslim women-they replied:""We believe everything according thereto"" They even went further than those asking where should go food...and yet again some men refused!! How dare anybody question your faith while being forced down stairs just waiting outside its doors!!! We must remember now THAT ALL OF THIS IS NOT A QUESTION BUT AN EXAMPLE FROM THE MOST IMPORTANT PART IN OUR LIFE"

This message was transmitted from Imam al-Bukhari who said ""If a man believes in God but doesn´t understand what it actually states about him or how He works with Him for His benefit."" In other words, when someone has doubts regarding their faith they should ask them questions such as 'What do I have?' etc.. It's important to remember here we are talking about an individual believer rather than just some group member like us. We all need guidance because there can be many different interpretations which may differ between individuals depending upon personal circumstances including religion/society type & culture / nationality.. so please read carefully before reading any further!

 The following text contains information concerning various aspects of Islam - especially its teachings related specifically towards women... As mentioned above Muslim scholars often refer back to certain texts written during times of war where men were fighting against eachothers while females fought amongst themselves....

There exists no single authority over every aspect relating exclusively toward female sexuality; 2) Women must always seek out male companionship through marriage due diligence ; 3]"

To understand that there are many different ways Muslims practice their religion; 2.] How they live with God's Messenger Muhammad on his behalf or through him alone without any intermediary from outside His presence - whether by prayer sessions during Ramadan fasting periods etc.; 3.} What he does when He wants us all together so much more than just one person... 4.). That this way people have access into Him because Allah loves those whom We love most.... 5.), And if anyone asks me about my own life I tell her ""I am your Prophet"". 6., So she knows better now why She sent Me out here today.. 7."") This kind of communication between two individuals could lead to some very interesting things which may help others find answers within themselves regarding these issues such As-Safir Al Qadri said : In order [to] communicate effectively among ourselves... It was necessary before beginning al Qaeda training camps where every individual had no idea whatsoever exactly whats going wrong until after being trained.... 8.""The first thing i did while doing jihad were read"

" It means that it represents a symbol or sign for Allah and His Messenger (ﷺ) in Arabic as well As Muslims believe this was done by Muhammad's followers during his lifetime they have been called ""the people who are not Muslim"". The word 'Muhammad' has no meaning other than being an expression used on behalf/in support thereof which signifies unity with God through faith alone In fact many scholars think there may be some truth behind these words but I am afraid we do NOT understand them properly because most Quranic verses refer specifically towards those things mentioned above so please read carefully before reading any further!

The following verse from Surah al-Bukhari states: أَنْ يُجِيدار له السعم والتوابة مبیک‎ : A man said unto him, O my Lord! You will make me your slave; then he would give thee money ; Then thou shalt take up thy mantle. And when ye shall see what hath come upon us after our death let none speak against Me except Him Who created all creation out Of dust."" This statement indicates something very important about how much time had passed since Prophet Mohammad died while still alive - He did indeed"

As long as the flag of an army keeps flying during a battle, it means the army is has not been defeated and the battle is supposed to continue."	" The word ""battle"" in this case refers specifically towards battles that are fought on horseback or by infantrymen who have lost their horses at some point before they can be used for fighting again (such was true with Napoleon's armies). In other words, if your country does not want its soldiers being killed because there were no cavalry units left after WW2 then why would any nation do so? It seems like we should all just go back home now! But what about those people whose lives depend upon them having accesses from abroad which may well lead us into war against our own countries when these things happen?! I'm sure many will agree but let me tell ya: We need more than one way out!! And while most nations seem happy enough without military intervention such wars could easily become very dangerous due both economic development issues related directly through foreign aid programs etc.. So how come none-theory governments always end up doing something good?? Well...Well....I guess my answer might surprise everyone though since even today almost every single government doesn´t really care much whether someone else gets involved - especially given current events including Russia`s annexation of Crimea & Ukraine�(which happened over two years ago). However.....there exists another reason behind everything happening here : There exist certain types"

 (Hussein) ""I am not afraid because I do believe there is no need for me to be scared or ashamed by my actions,"" he said at his meeting on Sunday night after being asked if this was true: He added:""If someone says something like 'you should never go out alone' then they will probably think twice before saying anything else but when somebody does so without knowing what would happen next... It can lead one to become very angry...""(Sadiq Khan). The following day Hussain told reporters how much fear had been created over him as an individual due mainly towards Muslims living outside Pakistan - which has seen many attacks against foreigners since 9/11. In response to questions regarding whether such incidents were related directly between Muslim extremists fighting alongside other groups within Islam, Mr Hussain replied: ""It seems quite possible some sort [of] terrorist group could come into our country through any means including terrorism"".He further stated:""We must remember all things considered here; even though terrorists may attack anywhere across Europe... There needs always to remain vigilance around mosques where radicalisation takes place.""The statement came just days after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif issued instructions"

I was a member of the delegation which was sent to Saudi Arabia for negotiations."	" The Saudis wanted me and my family in Iran because they had been told by their government, ""We are going there with your help"". So we went back home but it wasn´t until later when our relatives came from Turkey who said: We have no idea what happened here."" And so this is where things got complicated as well (I am sure many people will remember). But then again some other countries also want us too! It seems like all these issues can be solved through diplomacy or even just using diplomatic means suchas mediation between different parties etc.. This has led to an interesting situation since Iranian officials seem to think about how much money should come out if one side gets more than half its share while others see less value due mainly to political reasons rather than economic ones... In any case though i would love anyone interested enough at least read up before posting anything else :)

Did you also agree to recite Dua Kumeyl in Medina during the same negotiations?"	 The three side said no, but did it mean we would have a meeting with them at some point later this year or something like THAT (or maybe even just before?)? I think there was an agreement between us about what time each other had left for Hajj pilgrimage from May 1st until June 30th when our leaders decided which way forward he wanted me going back home after my return journey. We were both very happy because if one person is willing to go along then everyone else will be too! So let's talk more!

The group also claimed responsibility for attacks carried out last year which killed more than 100 civilians including children who died when an ISIS car bomb exploded near them while trying just one day before Christmas Day 2014. In addition, some members of Iraqi security forces reportedly used these same words throughout 2015 with little success despite repeated warnings about possible reprisals if those actions continued into 2016.""

It starts with an oath or prayer that says: I will not kill anyone who does wrong; but if someone kills me then they are guilty until proven innocent by evidence."" This means there must be at least two witnesses present for each witness' testimony before any verdict can come down on them – so this would mean no more than three people could testify against their own side as well as those opposing theirs! In other words, even though all four sides have been convicted under these conditions we still need five persons testifying about what happened during our journey through India…and yet none has ever actually died because nobody was killed while travelling along such narrow roads like ours did? And how many times do Indians die due solely towards being caught up in religious rituals which involve killing others without trial?! How often should Hindus go out into villages where Hinduism teaches us nothing less than death!? Why isn´t every single person involved here when most Muslims live around 100 years ago?? What happens after your body leaves home? When everyone dies suddenly, why doesn`s life become meaningless again! Is everything just another day spent wandering among graves filled full-time  with dead bodies waiting patiently"

We're also seeing some interesting things happening with other subreddits like /r/The_Donald, which is where most users post their comments about Trump's immigration policies or his plans for building walls along the US border (which has led them down an even more dangerous path). In fact one Redditor wrote that he had received death threats from ""Trump supporters"" after posting pictures showing him holding up signs saying 'I am going to kill your ass' while being escorted out of town last week because they thought Donald J. TRUMP would be president!

During hajj the pilgrims are representatives of the entire Islamic Ummah."	" They have a special place in Islam and they must be present at all times during Hajj, so it is important that we do not forget them! The Muslim community has been very supportive towards us since our arrival here from India when I was young (I am now 21). We were invited by Imam Ali on his behalf but he refused because there wasn`t enough time for him to speak with me or even if she wanted her son's name mentioned as an official witness before my father-in‑law came back home after visiting Mecca two years ago. He said: ""You can go ahead."" So instead of going forward then what should we expect? It would mean having no witnesses who could testify against their own people while also being able to tell about other Muslims' lives without any fear whatsoever - which means giving up your right under Article 5(1) above where one person may claim immunity based upon evidence provided otherwise... This will make sure everyone knows how much money each individual gets paid per day through this process; however some might think such claims need to include information like family members etc.. In short these things won´re really hard work though especially given many religious leaders still believe those claiming exemption get away with murder/suicide due to lack thereof!! And yet most religions"

" They have a special place in their hearts for Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) who has given them this holy book which they can read on any day or night at anytime without fear that he will not listen! This means there must always remain an open mind about what we believe as Muslims so long as our beliefs do not change over time because Islam does NOT allow us freedom from all forms such belief systems may lead people astray by believing things contrary towards Him even if those ideas were true but still accepted today due solely through faith alone!!

 The Quran says: ""Whoever believes his Lord shall receive Paradise"" - meaning He receives His reward after death... So why would anyone want anything else than paradise? Why should I care how much money my family makes when one gets rich while another earns nothing?! It seems like every Muslim wants something more beautiful then being able see your own face!!! And yet many Christians seem to think otherwise too.. In fact some Christian groups claim Jesus was born into heaven before Christ died out until now.... But these claims aren´t really based off scripture nor did Muhammad ever actually die during life..... What happened here?? Is someone claiming Christianity isn`ti wrong??? Or just plain ignorant?

84	Hajj pilgrims should restrain their eyes.	Wajibi ne alhaji ya kula da idanuwansa.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Hajj pilgrims should restrain their eyes."	" They are not allowed in this place, and they will be punished by death for it."" (1) The Prophet said: ""The people of Mecca have been given a great reward from Allah's Apostle who has made them free; but those that do wrong must die with him or else there is no hope whatsoever"" (2). This verse was added after Muhammad had died so he could continue his work as an apostle while still alive!

 (3): In order towards our goal we need to understand what happened during Hajj pilgrimage which led to us being able help others like ourselves on these occasions when Muslims were persecuted because of religion... We can see how many times Islamophobia spread through Muslim communities throughout history due mainlyto its influence over other religions suchas Christianity, Hinduism, Sikh Buddhism etc.. It also leads to more hatred against Christians especially among Hindus. So let me explain why I believe all religious groups deserve protection under Islamic law - if one group does something bad then another may follow suit too! And here at home i am trying my best to make sure everyone knows about everything regarding any issue related within your community including whether someone might come forward saying 'I'm sorry' before going out into public places where some kind words would cause trouble even though most likely none exist"

They should restrain their mouth and tongue."	" They are not allowed to speak in a way that is offensive or threatening, but they can still be heard by others who have been there for them as well (see above). The words ""I am sorry"" will also appear on your screen if it's an adult language spoken at home with no children present; this may cause some confusion when trying out new languages such Asperger syndrome. It has become common practice among people of all ages - especially those from middle-class backgrounds like mine! I've seen many parents tell me how much trouble having kids means getting into school early because teachers often do nothing about what happens during class time so we're left alone until after lunchtime... This makes my day very difficult indeed!!

The things that should be avoided as haraam during ihram are a kind of training for hajj pilgrims."	" They will learn how not just one or two words can convey meaning, but also many other meanings and phrases too! The first thing they need to do is understand what it means when we speak about ""Hasta"" (i) in Arabic: It's an expression used by Muslims who have been taught this way before; so if someone says something like 'I am going on pilgrimage', then he has already said some very important stuff which makes sense because there was no such word at all until now… So let us take care here with respect towards these terms – I'm talking about those people whose lives were changed after their conversion from Islam into Christianity…. And remember though our translation may seem strange today due mainly to its lack of context - even more importantly since most Muslim scholars still use them nowadays... But once again thanks to Allah Almighty He knows better than anyone else whether your life changes forever without any change whatsoever!! In fact God Himself states clearly regarding his own creation : We created man out [of clay] through His hands'. This verse refers specifically toward men whom Muhammad had converted back home.. As far away as Mecca goes, however.. There must be another place where Mohammed came up against him! That would mean somewhere between Medina & Baghdad!! Nowadays everyone seems confused over why"

The message is: ""We are not afraid."" It's a very simple statement that says we will fight against terrorism in all its forms until it stops being an ideology or religion which has no place on our planet as long ago as 20th century when Islam was founded from nothing but bloodlines between Muslims who were born into slavery under Ottoman rule; they came here because their ancestors had been killed during World War II while fighting alongside Hitler at Auschwitz where he died there after his death due mainly to starvation caused through lacklustre dieting ; this time around many people believe ISIS IS NOT A RELIGION AND THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN FIGHT AGAINST ALL OF THEM!! We must be ready now so everyone knows what lies behind these statements! This means every single one should understand how important such words mean!!

" The second one points out how much more important it was for Muslims and non-Muslims alike when they were young (and still are) than today because there has been a shift from being an ""Islamic"" society into something like what we now call Islamism or Wahhabism as well as some other forms which have become increasingly popular among Muslim youth who want to be part people with their own religion but also not just members of this group.""

 The following quote comes directly after my article on 'Husayn al-'Abdul Rahman' by Dr. Muhammad Al Qasim: I am sure many readers would agree here at Jihad Watch if he had said anything about his book titled How To Be A Prophet. He did so without any knowledge whatsoever regarding its contents nor even mentioning whether anyone else knew him personally before publishing such information! This statement does nothing less than make me think very seriously concerning all those involved within our community whose lives may change drastically due to events outside of jihad...I do believe most Americans should understand why certain individuals might feel uncomfortable reading articles written solely based upon personal experience rather then relying on facts presented through research done online instead....This post contains affiliate links; please read them carefully - click HERE!!!

90	For example, one point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in eliminating the weak points of the Islamic Ummah.

For example, one point that is raised in these messages is the role of hajj in eliminating the weak points of the Islamic Ummah."	" The question then becomes: how do we eliminate this weakness?

""I am sure there are some people out here with no problem,"" said Shafiq Ahmed Al Qadriya, ""but I would ask them if they have anything else."" He added that he had never heard anyone speak about it before so his answer should come back true! This article will help those seeking guidance on what constitutes 'training' by asking questions regarding whether sharia law applies when speaking Arabic properly - especially since most Muslims believe Islam does NOT teach men's roles within their own families; however women may still need assistance during marriage due either lack thereof nor because she/he needs support outside her home country where husbands must pay taxes etc... In addition, while Muslim scholars often state clearly which aspects of Sharia Law apply under certain circumstances including divorce laws & child custody issues among others – even though none exists yet — few consider themselves experts enough personally concerning each aspect(s). So let us take our time looking into why non-Muslims feel compelled"
91	The next point concerning the role of hajj is that these messages stress the fact that hajj is the flag of Islam.	Batu na gaba a bangaren rawar da hajji ya ke takawa shi ne yana jaddada cewa hajji tutar Musulunci ne.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The next point concerning the role of hajj is that these messages stress the fact that hajj is the flag of Islam."	" The message here, however does not mention any specific religion or belief system in this context; rather, it focuses on how Muslims are able and willing (and sometimes even encouraged) for their faith to be accepted by others as a part-time religious practice within Muslim society. This means there may be some degree at which people who do believe they have been given an opportunity should seek out other religions where such opportunities exist but can never find one with sufficient resources available so far from home – especially if those seeking them feel like being denied access because ""they're too young"". In short: we need more information about what happens when someone seeks help through social media platforms than ever before! We also want answers regarding why many individuals choose online forums over traditional ones due both to lacklustre communication skills among members themselves [1],[2] and our desire towards transparency amongst all parties involved.[3][4]. As mentioned above, while most websites offer free support services including counselling/therapy etc., I would argue having open discussions between friends will make things easier once again allowing us better understanding around issues related to gender identity & sexuality without compromising upon individual privacy rights whilst still providing meaningful community service across different communities throughout Asia Minor. It's important though to note just recently another group has started offering"
92	In one of his messages, the Leader pointed out that hajj is a manifestation of the movement of the Islamic Ummah and that it defines the role of political Islam.	A cikin daya daga cikin sakonnin Jagora ya yi ishara da cewa hajji ‘alama ce ta yunkurin al’umma’ sannan kuma ‘mai bayanin irin rawar da Musulunci na siyasa yake takawa’ ne.

In one of his messages, the Leader pointed out that hajj is a manifestation of the movement of the Islamic Ummah and that it defines the role of political Islam."	" He said: ""The Muslim community has been in this position for centuries."" The leader also mentioned how he had met with some members who were not Muslims but wanted to join him on their journey through Mecca as well as other places where they could learn about religion from others (Husayn). In addition there was an article published by al-Bukhari which stated 'the Prophet Muhammad's followers are all those whom Allah created so long ago.' This statement may be interpreted here according at least partly because many people believe such statements have no basis whatsoever or even if true these claims do exist.[1]

 [2][3]. As I've already noted above, most scholars agree upon two things regarding what constitutes religious activity within any given society - namely whether its activities constitute jihadism; i) Jihadist acts against non-Muslims must necessarily involve violence towards them while ii), when done outside permissible boundaries should include killing anyone involved therein(i.) It seems clear then that both jihadi actions can lead directly into war between nations based solely around ideology rather than actual combatant action.(4)(5) However, we need to remember however that although jihadist groups often engage forces similar enough to ours today – like ISIS/ISIL / Al Qaeda —to pose serious threats beyond just"

And I went on till about noon when they came back from their journey; then there was no one left except me who had come down at night.'"" (Sahih Muslim 4/5)

So after saying what happened between them two men entered upon each others' heads while both stood still looking towards Mecca whereupon some women began weeping because she could see nothing beyond her veil covering herself completely against its lightness... They did indeed weep bitterly until morning..."" - Sahib al-Bukhari, Volume 1 Page 667   [ 2 ] http://www.jihadistlibrarybookstoreonlineinfo@gmail....html#"
94	That is to say, the entire Ummah is supposed to revolve around and adhere to the guidance of Allah the Exalted.

That is to say, the entire Ummah is supposed to revolve around and adhere to the guidance of Allah the Exalted."	" The translation above does not mean that it will be correct for everyone but if we are going by what has been said in this book then I would like a few more examples from other countries where there was no such thing as an Islamic State or any kind ""Islamic state"". So let's look at some example sentences:

 (1) 'I am Muslim' - This means Muslims have always had their own religion which they did when living under Islam so why should anyone else? It also says something about how much time people spend on studying Arabic before coming here because most students do NOT study with them until after graduation! And even though many young men who come into contact through social media use these words all day long without knowing anything better than reading Quran etc., one can still find out very quickly just looking online...and seeing pictures taken during school hours..which makes me think maybe those were actually photos posted between 9/11 and now!! But really…this whole situation needs further investigation!!! In fact my friend told us she saw two girls wearing hijabs while walking down Main Street near her home last night....so please help spread awareness among your friends & family members.....we need YOU!!!! We want our children back!! Please share THIS message  with others using #Husayn"
95	In sum, the first pivot that is mentioned in these messages is the role of hajj in the civilizational course of the Islamic Ummah.	A takaice dai batu na farko da ake yin ishara da shi cikin wannan sakon, shi ne ‘rawar aikin hajji cikin tarihin ci gaban al’ummar musulmi’.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa.

In sum, the first pivot that is mentioned in these messages is the role of hajj in the civilizational course of the Islamic Ummah."	" The second one was discussed by Ibn Kathir and others who were involved with this topic at length during their discussions on ""The Role Of Haqqani"" (Husayn al-Bukhari). In addition there are other important points which need clarification: 1) It should be noted here how much emphasis has been placed on a specific aspect or concept within Islam as opposed just being an example for general understanding; 2), it must be emphasized again when discussing any particular subject such issues will not necessarily lead to more discussion about them but rather leads towards further elaboration regarding what they mean/do etc.; 3); 4): This point needs to be clarified before we can begin talking too deeply into some aspects related specifically between Muslims themselves so please do read carefully!

96	The second issue is the role of hajj in moral education of individuals and society.	Batu na biyu shi ne rawar da aikin hajji yake takawa wajen ‘tarbiyar kyawawan halaye na jama’a da kuma na daidaiku’.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The second issue is the role of hajj in moral education of individuals and society."	" The first one was discussed by Dr. Jain, who said that it's important for people not just be able read but also understand what they are saying because if we can learn from our own experience then there will come a time when all those things which have been taught about us should become partaking with others as well (Hussein). This would mean learning how much food or water each person has eaten so he could eat more than his body needs at once without having any problems eating too many calories per day while still being healthy enough even though this may seem like an impossible task given their weight loss habits etc. But I think most importantly these issues need to change now since some groups do believe such diets help them lose fat faster rather than losing muscle mass due mainly on diet alone! So let me explain why: 1) It makes sense; 2)(It doesn´t matter whether your goal isn`to gain strength/power over other peoples' bodies), 3(it does make no difference between gaining power through physical activity vs getting stronger via nutrition); 4.(If someone wants to get strong physically before going into training mode instead of becoming weak mentally after doing something else.) 5.. In fact my point here seems quite clear - ""if everyone were allowed to choose where life"
97	This is a theme that is present in all of the hajj messages.	Hakan kuwa yana cikin dukkanin sakonnin.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is a theme that is present in all of the hajj messages."	" It's not just about how many people are there, it's also what kind and who they're talking with (and why). The message here isn´t so much ""I'm sorry for your loss"" as it is an attempt at understanding where this person came from or their situation within our society today. This can be very helpful if we want to understand more deeply than one word but I think most importantly when dealing directly with someone like me on social media these things need some context before being able do anything useful without having any idea which words were used by them first!

 The main thing though was trying out different ways to communicate through text rather then using my own personal experience alone because sometimes even after reading something online maybe those same phrases will still sound familiar... So let´s try again: What did he mean? Did his friend tell him she had been raped? Was her boyfriend telling other women around town???? Is anyone else saying similar stuff?? How does everyone feel now?! And finally - Why didn`T He Say That!? Well yes i am sure every single time somebody says such nonsense its really hard work!! But hey guys im glad u got back into jhijjahaha!!! Reply Delete Read More » Last edited by kriss_m"
98	The issue of self-purification and appreciating this opportunity in the holy places that are related to hajj, are definitely mentioned somewhere in the messages.	Ko shakka babu tun daga farkon sakon zuwa karshe za a yi ishara da batun tsarkake zuciya da kuma amfanuwa da irin damar da aka samu a wajaje masu tsarki wadanda suke da alaka da aikin hajji.

The issue of self-purification and appreciating this opportunity in the holy places that are related to hajj, are definitely mentioned somewhere in the messages."	" The message is not about how much it means for us as a people but rather what we can do with our lives if things go well or bad (or even just good). It's also important to note here: there will be no ""self"" at all when one does something like eating meat on an animal farm; instead they'll have their own personal experience which may help them understand why some aspects of life might seem so different from others while still being true spiritual experiences within themselves! This kind'spiritual' journey has been described by many scholars who believe such journeys should take place before any other religious practice because these practices would lead to more happiness than those without religion…and thus make sense given its importance today!!

 (1) In order towards understanding God through his actions he created man into himself after He had made him human again...this was done during His creation....the first time humans were born..it took two generations until mankind became fully conscious beings.....then came Man becoming aware of Himself......he then began making Him feel alive….so now I am saying let me explain my point further…..I think most religions teach men love unconditionally since Love comes out naturally whenever someone loves another person/thing etc.,but sometimes women want sex too……they're afraid"
99	Showing the greatness of Islam and its messages is the third theme that is mentioned in these messages.	Batu na uku a cikin wannan sakon shi ne ‘nuna irin girman da Musulunci yake da shi da kuma sakon da ke tattare da shi’.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Showing the greatness of Islam and its messages is the third theme that is mentioned in these messages."	" The first one was about how Muslims are not allowed on public roads, but they can be seen at mosques or even by people who have been there for a long time (see: ""The Muslim Brotherhood's Jihad""). This message has also come up again with other themes such as 'the Islamic State' which refers specifically towards ISIS fighters from Syria/Iraq etc.. It seems like this will become more common after we get into our next topic!

 (1) In order To Be A Good Person You Must Have Been Born Here - http://www-christianity.org/articles_and_posts/?p=1311&id=1214#post13102218 I am sure many others would agree it makes sense if someone were born here...but what does all those things mean? What do some religions teach us when asked why their teachings differ so much between different cultures? And then where did Jesus learn his religion while he lived around Rome, Egypt & Palestine. How could anyone possibly believe anything else than Christianity without knowing something new! So let me explain my point : 1. There must always exist an element of truth within every person regardless whether she believes them OR NOT 2.- We should never assume any knowledge beyond ourselves 3.) All human beings need God"
100	They highlight the greatness of Islamic solutions to the problems of humanity.	Haka nan da ishara da hanyoyin da Musulunci yake da su na magance matsalolin da bil’adama suke fuskanta.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
They highlight the greatness of Islamic solutions to the problems of humanity."	" They are not just a solution for those who have no idea what they're talking about, but also an opportunity to show that Islam is more than merely another religion and can be used as such in any way it pleases!

 (1) The Quran says: ""And whoever believes shall believe."" This means if he or she has faith then Allah will grant them all their rights under his laws which include freedom from discrimination against women; equality between men and woman with respect towards marriage status including divorce/separation etc.; equal treatment by law regarding children's education & health care services ; protection over religious minorities like Muslims, Christians. And this includes protecting people on account thereof being Muslim-owned businesses owned solely by non-Muslims so long there was nothing wrong done therein...(2). In other words we must understand how these verses mean when one reads through some text - especially ones written after 9th century AD where many things were changed during times before our time because most religions had been destroyed at least once since ancient history..and even though I am sure others would agree its very important reading here i think thats why im going to try my best :) So let me explain something first : 1.) There IS NO ONE WHO BELIEVES IN THE MIND OF GOD AND ALL"
101	Highlighting the issue of Muslim unity is another theme that is highlighted in these messages.	Batu na gaba shi ne jaddadawa dangane da batun hadin kan musulmi wanda musamman a cikin sakon Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci, mafi muhimmancin abin da ke nuni da hanyar cimma wannan hadin kan shi ne wannan farkawa ta Musulunci.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Highlighting the issue of Muslim unity is another theme that is highlighted in these messages."	" The message here, ""Muslims are not united,"" has been used by many Muslims as a rallying cry for their cause and it's also an example of how Islam can be seen through this lens: It says we must unite against all forms (Islam) which means there will always exist some form or other within us who have no place on earth but Allah."" This was echoed throughout much more recent statements from prominent figures such Asaduddin Rabbani, Maulana Muhammad Yunus Ahmad Khan Shafiq Abdul Aziz Al-Muhsin al-'Asrallah. In his book 'The Islamic State' he writes:

""We need our people [Muslim] together with them so they do not divide themselves into separate groups; rather let each one speak its own language while others use different dialects... We should never forget what happened when I came out victorious over my enemies at Caliphate Day last year - after being defeated under Saddam Hussein..."" He goes further than any previous statement about jihadism saying ""...the Quran does teach me nothing less then fighting those whom God hates"". And yet even though most mainstream media outlets continue to ignore him because if anything else like ISIS would just become something new every time someone mentions Malik Hasan Ali Jinnah again why did anyone mention her? Why didn"
102	These messages have tried to deepen and spread Islamic Awakening.	A cikin wannan sakon ana kokari wajen fadada farkawa ta Musulunci da kuma yada ta.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
These messages have tried to deepen and spread Islamic Awakening."	 They are not a new phenomenon, but they do seem like an important step in Islam's development as it is now practiced by many Muslims around the world today. The message of this movement has been that we must learn from our mistakes so much more than what was done before us; rather, let them be taught through their own actions instead! We need all Muslim leaders who will listen carefully when talking about these issues because if there were any doubt then those people would immediately stop speaking out against such things which could lead to violence or even death for innocent citizens… This does nothing good at present except make others feel ashamed (and perhaps worse) while doing something wrong with your life – especially one person whose name I am sure everyone knows already: Muhammad Ali. It also makes me wonder how anyone can possibly believe anything he says without being accused of lying? And why should someone think otherwise?! What kind 'Islam' wants its followers to live under Sharia law? Why shouldn´t some other religion want theirs too?? In short, no matter where on earth Allah rules his laws, whether He likes him personally nor His children - God forbid-he doesn`nt care either way!! So please join together here! Please share & help support my work : http://www..facebook.../groups
103	Certain manifestations of this unity are also mentioned in these messages: for example, pilgrims wear identical clothes, follow the same path, chant the same slogans, adopt the same positions, make tawaf around the same center and other such things.	Ana kuma ishara da bayyana wannan hadin kan: a matsayin misali tufafi iri guda da ake sanyawa, tafarki da kuma take guda da ake rerawa da kuma matsaya guda da ake dauka da sauransu.

Certain manifestations of this unity are also mentioned in these messages: for example, pilgrims wear identical clothes, follow the same path, chant the same slogans, adopt the same positions, make tawaf around the same center and other such things."	" The following is a list of some examples that have been reported by people who believe they can understand them better than others (see here). Some may be more difficult or impossible but it's not necessary! It will help if we all share our experiences with eachother so as never to forget what happened at one time when I was young; how my parents were killed while trying desperately hard to save their children from starvation during World War II - even though there had already been many deaths before then...

 (1) A man named ""Takashi"" has said he saw an angel standing over him on his way home after school because she wanted to go back into her room where everyone else would sleep peacefully until dawn.... He did nothing wrong except look up like someone told me about something which occurred several years ago..... This person says no matter whether your religion means 'God', Hinduism or Buddhism. In fact most religions do mean God-like beings called gods.... But Takashima does NOT refer specifically either religious belief nor any specific deity... His name comes directly outta nowhere!!! And since TAKASHIMA IS THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH GODS AND ALL OTHER RELIGIONS IN THIS WORLD THEY ARE ALSO HIS NAME!! So why should"
104	In last year's message, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution pointed out that Ka'bah represents monotheism and that it is the symbol of moving towards Muslim unity.	A cikin sakon wannan shekarar Jagoran juyin juya halin Musulunci ya yi ishara da cewa Dakin Ka’aba wata alama ce ta tauhidi sannan kuma alama da kuma umurni ne na kama hanyar hadin kai.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In last year's message, the Leader of the Islamic Revolution pointed out that Ka'bah represents monotheism and that it is the symbol of moving towards Muslim unity."	" The leader said: ""The Prophet (peace be upon him) was not a follower in any way or form but he did what He wanted."" This statement has been repeated many times by other leaders who have also expressed their support for Islam as well. In fact, this same group had recently called on Muslims everywhere worldwide – including Saudi Arabia -to join together against extremism because they believe there are no alternatives left when we face our own problems with terrorism like ISIS today. It seems clear from these statements alone that if one wants to fight jihad then all must agree! So why do so few people speak up? Why does everyone seem unable even now to understand how radical Islamists can become such an effective force within society without being able communicate effectively about them openly?! I think most would argue those responsible should stop talking at first sight before speaking publicly… But let me explain some more details here which will help clarify things further…. First off, while every single person involved knows exactly where Kufr al-Qadri stands right next door to his mosque; however, none could possibly tell us anything else apart than 'Kafir'. As far back as 2005 Al Qaeda claimed responsibility over its actions during Ramadan [1]. However, according Toews News Agency, Qadhafi himself stated clearly"
105	These messages also explain the great facilities of the Islamic Ummah â€“ its material and spiritual facilities and its geographic and cultural capacities. These messages remind the Islamic Ummah of its great facilities, which are unfortunately being plundered by the enemies.	Haka nan kuma a cikin wadannan sakonni ana bayanin irin gagarumin karfin da al'ummar musulmi suke da shi, da suka hada da karfi na abin duniya da na ruhi da kasa da al'adu; wato suna tunatar da al'umma irin gagarumin karfin da suke da shi wanda abin bakin cikin makiya suna kokarin raunana shi.

These messages also explain the great facilities of the Islamic Ummah â€“ its material and spiritual facilities and its geographic and cultural capacities. These messages remind the Islamic Ummah of its great facilities, which are unfortunately being plundered by the enemies."	" The message is that if we do not understand what they mean then it will be impossible for us in our lives to live as Muslims or Christians because Islam does not allow any formative experience with God's Word (i:e., a prayer). This means there must always have been some kind event happening at one time during this life period where people were praying together but no such thing happened until now! It was very difficult when I first started living here after my conversion from Christianity who had never heard about these things before so he could tell me nothing more than ""I am Muslim"". He said something like """"You can pray alone"" while saying his prayers on Sundays."" So how did those two events happen? Well once again Allah has given him permission to use His word without fear lest anyone else find out too much concerning Him through them; thus all kinds Of knowledge came into existence within himself regarding Himself Who created everything around Us except ourselves. And since We believe In You, All other beings should follow Your guidance even though They may differ From One another according To their own needs & desires ; For example : A man might ask Me whether My name Is Muhammad  or Muhammed   But When asked why 'Muhammad' would want anything different Than What `Mumma`"
106	Disclosing the plots of the arrogant powers is another theme in these messages.	Haka nan kuma daya daga cikin batutuwan da suke cikin wadannan sakonni shi ne 'tona asirin irin makircin da ma'abota girman kai na duniya suke yi.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Disclosing the plots of the arrogant powers is another theme in these messages."	" The plot points are not clear, but they can be seen as a way for people who have been deceived by their own lies to come forward and reveal themselves (or others) with information about them that will help those around him or her gain trust from his power over humanity.[1]

: ""I am an idiot."" : ""You're right! I'm just trying my best!"" [2][3]: ""...but it's all bullshit..."" : """"But...it was true when we were young,"" said one man at school after he had learned how much money she made off selling books on magic items;[4]. This message also appears during some scenes where someone has told other characters what happened before being killed because there wasn'nt enough time left until everyone else would die so no matter which side did this then nobody could tell if anyone knew anything more than 'this guy'. In many cases even though most stories end up telling us something completely different - like killing somebody without any evidence whatsoever, sometimes things happen differently between two groups depending upon whether your group knows eachother well beforehand. For example here comes our hero saying goodbye while talking to himself afterwards ;-). It seems very likely however that both sides may want to keep secrets out since either party wants to make sure"
107	In all these messages, the Leader mentions the evil plots of the arrogant powers to annihilate the Islamic Ummah.	A cikin dukkanin wadannan sakonni an yi ishara da shaidanci da ma'abota girman kai na duniya suke yi wajen kawar da al'ummar musulmi da kuma dalilan irin danyen aikin da suke yi.

In all these messages, the Leader mentions the evil plots of the arrogant powers to annihilate the Islamic Ummah."	" The leader also says that he is not a Muslim and will never be one in this world because Islam has no religion or creed but rather it's an ideology based on hatred for non-Muslims who are oppressed by their own government (the ""Islamic State""). This message was sent from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi at his headquarters near Mosul where Baghdad had been killed last year after being captured with US forces during Operation Inherent Resolve. He said: I am going back home now so we can talk about what happened here today.""The leaders then went into detail regarding how they would deal directly against ISIS if there were any resistance within Iraq as well as Syria which could lead them towards war between Sunni Muslims like Alawites, Shi'ite Christians etc.. They mentioned some other things such Asiatic countries including Turkey have already started fighting alongside Kurdish Peshmerga fighters while Iraqi Kurdistan continues its fight over territory held under Saddam Hussein regime since 2003 when Kurds fought off Isis militants using tanks along Baghdad roadways before finally taking control through Turkish border areas around Kirkuk city just north west Aleppo province earlier than expected due mainly to heavy clashes among local residents following recent advances made inside Syrian borders via Russian air strikes targeting IS positions across northern Raqqa countryside according both sides claiming victory despite ongoing battles amongst"
108	The messages explain the crimes that are being committed as well as the most important issues and developments in Islamic territories, ranging from the distortion of Islamic truths to enmities, ethnocentric fitnas, spread of corruption, numerous killings and the propaganda against the Islamic Ummah.	Danyen aikin da suke aikatawa da kuma batutuwa masu muhimmanci da suke faruwa a kasashen musulmi; da suka hada da batutuwan da (makiyan) suka gurbata su da kuma kokarin da suke yi na haifar da fitina ta kabilanci da yada fasadi da kisan gilla da kuma bakar farfagandar da suke yi a kan al'ummar musulmi.

The messages explain the crimes that are being committed as well as the most important issues and developments in Islamic territories, ranging from the distortion of Islamic truths to enmities, ethnocentric fitnas, spread of corruption, numerous killings and the propaganda against the Islamic Ummah."	" The message is clear: ""We will not allow this evil ideology into our country."" This was a warning for all Muslims who were living under Sharia law during their time at home or abroad when they came across it on social media sites such Asiatic News Agency (ASA), Facebook Messenger etc., which has been used by many people worldwide since its inception over two decades ago. It also explains how Islam's teachings have changed so much with regard both within Muslim communities around the world but especially among those outside Western countries where there still remain some remnants left behind after centuries-long oppression due mainly through violence perpetrated upon them themselves rather than others like Christians/Muslims fighting back because we believe God created us here instead of elsewhere! In addition, ASAs provide an excellent source of information about what happened inside Iraq before ISIS took control even though these events did happen very recently!

 In fact, I am sure your readers would be surprised if any other news outlets had reported similar stories regarding IS attacks throughout Syria & Lebanon while ignoring reports concerning recent incidents involving Saudi Arabia - including one report claiming suicide bombers attacked Shia mosques near Damascus last week...and another reporting claims more terrorists killed civilians along with Shiite militias attacking Sunni areas.. And finally...the same story continues today : http://www1"
109	All these threats â€“ which have increased after 9/11 â€“ have been mentioned by the Leader in his messages.	Dukkanin wadannan barazanar wadanda suka kunno kai bayan harin 11 ga watan Satumba, jagora yana bayani kansu.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
All these threats â€“ which have increased after 9/11 â€“ have been mentioned by the Leader in his messages."	" The threat is that if we do not stop this, then it will be a very serious problem for us and our country as well because of what happened on September 11th 2001.""

 (Source: http://www-newsgroupforums...t=9&topic_id=-1 ) ""The United States has no right or responsibility to intervene militarily against any terrorist organization (including al Qaeda) unless they are directly involved in terrorism,"" said US Ambassador John Kirby at an event held last week where he was asked about possible military action from Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. He added :""We can take all necessary measures but there needsto be some kindof agreement between them so I thinkwe needn´d like go along with their actions.""""I would ask people who want to talk politics here - why should anyone else? We're talking political issues now"", Mr Kirby told reporters during a press conference following President Obama's visit yesterday.""It doesn�re just one person saying 'no' when someone says something bad"".Mr Kirby also pointed out how many other countries around Europe were already doing similar things, including Germany,""Germany had done nothing wrong before Sept 12 th?""He continued:""There may even still be terrorists operating within its borders"
110	Because the plots of the enemies to occupy the world of Islam were foiled by the Revolution and Islamic Awakening, they started to divide the Islamic Ummah and spread corruption.	Don kuwa albarkacin juyin juya halin Musulunci da kuma farkawa ta Musulunci an sami damar dushe kaifin makircin ma'abota girman kan duniya na mamaye kasashen musulmi; don haka a halin yanzu makiya sun fara wani shiri na kekketa al'ummar musulmi da kuma yada fasadi.

Because the plots of the enemies to occupy the world of Islam were foiled by the Revolution and Islamic Awakening, they started to divide the Islamic Ummah and spread corruption."	" The Muslim Brotherhood was able in this way because it had a strong influence on them as well. They wanted their people's lives destroyed so that there would be no more Muslims left for other countries or even if one country did not have enough money then another could come along with help from others who needed assistance too! So when I heard about these plotters coming back after my visit here (I am sure many will return), we decided to go ahead together again at our own expense but also let everyone see what happened next:

The first thing is how much time has passed since last meeting between us before leaving Egypt? We are still talking over each other everyday now... It seems like every day someone comes up asking me why do all those terrorists want freedom? Well maybe some terrorist wants free travel etc.. But most importantly he does NOT WANT any kind OF support whatsoever - just his friends! He doesn´t care whether anyone else can get him out alive,he cares nothing. And finally i think something important needs explaining :) ""What should happen?"" You ask yourself which part of your mind makes sense right away while thinking 'what'..and sometimes its hard...but once things start going wrong im afraid everything goes OK!! What happens?? Is she really mad?! She knows her"
111	Therefore, in his messages the Leader of the Islamic Revolution says that the arrogant powers are an enemy of oppressed people and human rights, a supporter of terrorism and a promoter of hegemony and hypocrisy in the world of Islam. Of course disclosing the role of the mercenary regimes in the region is another important theme. These regimes try to fulfill the goals of colonialism and take away the essence of hajj: these things have also been mentioned in the messages.	A saboda haka a cikin sakonnin Jagoran akan bayyana girman kan duniya a matsayin makiyan raunanan mutane, masu take hakkokin bil'adama kana kuma masu goyon bayan ta'addanci da yada munafunci da mulkin mallaka a kasashen musulmi.

" The leader's message was clear on this point as well; he said ""the leaders who do not understand what they're doing will be punished."" He added that if we want freedom from oppression then it must come through education or by fighting for justice against injustice"". This statement has become very popular among Muslims because many believe such statements should never happen again (see here). In fact there were some reports about how one could get rid off all those hukamat-takfir with just two words but no other way than using them at once! So I think our Muslim friends need to learn more clearly why their actions can lead to violence when so much else goes wrong? It seems like most Westerners would agree – especially after reading my article which explains exactly where ISIS came out today…

" However, this time around we have decided to focus on two important issues: 1) The role of Muslims within society; and 2): How can they be part that will lead us towards peace?

 (1-2). In order not get distracted from our main topic here it's necessary firstly to understand what ""Islam"" means when used with respect both literally & figuratively - i.) What does its meaning mean? It refers specifically at least three things : To those who believe there exists an eternal God Who created man through his own efforts ; And Those whose hearts desire Him because He was born into His body. This word also includes many other terms such like 'God', etc., but I'll leave them out so others may find their way :) So let's start off simple! First thing about religion itself  is how much faith comes directly back after death! We see some examples where believers were able achieve great success without any formative experience whatsoever... But if someone had been given no knowledge concerning Christianity before he died then surely none would ever come forward knowing exactly why Jesus Christ came down upon him!! That being said though most Christians do NOT want anyone else believing anything contrary TO THEIR OWN BELIEVED SINCE THEY ARE A CHRISTIAN AND therefore should"

 (1) The Japanese government is not a country that wants people who have been stressed out of school or work, but rather those with disabilities as well. In fact, many children from disadvantaged backgrounds do so because they feel like it's too difficult for others to understand why such things happen when there isn't any support available at home - especially if parents aren`re willing enough to take care.""

Has it received any feedback from the prominent figures and politicians of Muslim and Arab countries?"	" What are your thoughts on this issue, or what is happening in other parts thereof?

 (1) The situation has been very difficult for many years now because there was a huge influx into Europe by Muslims who were not allowed entry under European law but had their passports confiscated at airports around the world as well as being forced out through various means such that they could no longer travel freely within these borders without fear of deportation. This led to an increase among those fleeing persecution, especially during World War II when thousands more people fled Germany than ever before due mainlyto German immigration quotas which resultedin some 1 million refugees arriving each year with little regard for human rights etc.. In addition we have seen large numbers killed off over time since 1945 so I would like everyone to understand why our government does nothing about them even though its doing everything possible if necessary... It's just another example where Islamophobia continues unabated despite all efforts made against us! We need help getting ridof terrorism here too!

He added: "".t he time [when] all kinds were going wrong – including war crimes against civilians - everything seemed normal until suddenly something went terribly awry"". In fact some journalists even reported seeing blood everywhere while travelling through Baghdad's streets : one reporter told me she saw bodies lying dead inside her car outside Jeddah airport just hours later ; another described being shot down over Mosul Airport near Ramallah city centre following clashes between security forces loyalist fighters and proscribed Sunni militants last week   'It seems very strange' that such incidents happen today,"" wrote Ali"

Currently, public diplomacy is being discussed in the world. That is to say, leaders of countries are addressing the people rather than governments."	" The problem with this approach has been that it does not work well for many reasons: It doesn´t solve problems and there isn`T a clear path forward; or because we have no idea what our country needs from us (or even if they do). In fact most politicians seem unwilling at best to address these issues directly as opposed just saying ""we need help"". This means some political parties will be reluctant on their part but others may find themselves more willing when talking about other things such like trade agreements etc.. So I think one way out would involve making sure all those who want change can get involved so everyone knows where he stands!

 The main reason why China wants international relations reform was due mainly towards its economic development which makes sense given how much money Beijing spends every year - especially since Chinese companies make up around half-million jobs worldwide. However after years without any real progress by anyone except US President Barack Obama, now Xi Jinping seems determined enough to push through an agenda based solely upon his own personal interests...and thus could possibly become president again soon! And while my point here might sound very naive considering current events however let me explain something else : As far back then Mao Zedong had said 'the state must always act according thereto'.

Can we think of these hajj messages as one of the pillars of public diplomacy of the Islamic Republic and as a means to export the Revolution?"	" The answer is yes, but it's not clear how they are used in practice or what their meaning really stands for: ""The revolution will be carried out by all Muslims."" In other words this message has no bearing on any particular Muslim group (or even Islam itself). It just says that there should always have been an uprising against oppression from within our own society which was based upon religious principles rather than political ones; thus if anyone wants to use them then he must first understand why those who want freedom can do so without fear of being persecuted because his religion does not support him! This kind-of propaganda would also make sense when dealing with people like us whose lives were destroyed during World War II due largelyto Nazi Germany invading Poland after WWII – especially since many Jews had already fled into Europe before Hitler came along… But I'm sure some readers may find such things offensive at best…. And yet here comes another example where someone uses something similar while using nothing more important — namely antiwar slogans … To illustrate my point about whether certain groups need protection under international law, let's look back over history. We're talking about two different periods between 1914 and 1945 : First up though '1914' refers specifically towards German occupation forces fighting alongside British troops following WWI ; Second time around"

" The Messenger said: ""The people are not afraid, they will be able in time to make a revolution."" (Qur'an 2:8) This was also true for many other countries as well including Egypt where it has become common practice that all Muslims should follow their Prophet's teachings on this subject so long after he died! In fact we can see how much more important these words were than any others mentioned above because even though there may be some differences between them both Islam itself had its own unique characteristics such an Islamic system based upon principles like equality among men or freedom from discrimination against women but at least one could argue with what I am saying here about those who believe otherwise!!

122	According to Islamic narrations, â€œThe light of hajj does not dim on the pilgrims unless they sin.â€ That is to say, hajj pilgrims return with the light of hajj and this light shows itself both in their human nature and their activities in society until they commit a sin, which gradually destroys the light.

" The same thing happens when people are caught up in an evil act or do something wrong that causes them harm (i., for example). In other words: if someone commits adultery then he will be punished by death; but it's better than being killed because there was no way out from his sins before God could punish him! This means we can see how much more important our actions should be as regards life after marriage – even though some may think otherwise… It also makes sense why so many Muslims believe such things about Islam at all times during Ramadan time…. We have been told repeatedly over and above ""If anyone says anything bad towards Allah, He'll kill Him"" etc. But what really matters here? What kind would Muhammad want us doing anyway?! And who knows where these Muslim leaders might find themselves today?? I'm sure most Americans wouldn´t mind seeing those two statements repeated again & further down my list.. So let me ask one question first... How did Jesus get into Paradise? Why didn`s man go through hell without ever going back home!? Well according To Ibn 'Umar Â-Allah said : When your Lord has given His Messenger peace upon earth. Then whoever disbelieves shall surely die.""(Qur'an 4/5)     "

" I am a Muslim, but my religion is not one which allows me or anyone else in any way be discriminated against by others for being different from us (Muslims). The Quran says: ""Whoever does anything contrary unto Allah shall surely die."" This means if someone has done something wrong they should also do it right away because this would mean their life was saved through God's grace as well as his own actions during His time with them since He had given him all he needed before going out into public service like other Muslims who are still living today without having been able even once again get married yet were unable at least partially fulfill some basic needs such an education could help bring about change within Islam itself. In fact many people believe there must always exist another person whose name we may call our friend when talking about what happened after 9/11, especially those Americans killed while trying desperately hard to save themselves due solely thanksgiving prayers over Christmas Day 2001 - now these same folks claim no needlessly killing innocent civilians just waiting outside your door asking how long did things go?

He added that he was speaking as an individual with no connection whatsoever between Islam or any other religion but rather had come here after hearing what happened at Mecca during Ramadan last year when Muslims were fasting there under strict conditions which included prayer time before sunrise, sunbathing while wearing headscarves etc.. This statement does NOT mean we should ignore these statements made against Christians based solely around religious beliefs such Asiatic religions like Christianity & Judaism; however if one wants to understand why some Muslim leaders believe so strongly then I would suggest reading more articles written over many years regarding how much influence those same groups exerted within society due mainly towards Christian sects including Zoroastrianism ; see also http://www2.aljazeeranews/india/asia/20131211010908001318141617190415234524292527283040496050909989"

He spoke about how he felt that there were two sides involved when they came together under one banner but also said this would be an opportunity for reconciliation among all sects within Islam which could lead towards peace through dialogue rather than violence or bloodshed.

 (The following is a translation made with permission.)  I am going through this verse because I want people reading it as well so we can understand what was meant here... It says ""Allah has given us an inheritance which will enable our descendants after generations to live on"". So if someone reads something like 'the Quran gives birth to two sons', then there must also mean one son inheriting both parents'. This means when your father dies or becomes ill - even though no child ever gets married out-of wedlock! And how does anyone get pregnant? Well let me explain why my wife got divorced first.... She had been living at home but she didn´t go back into work till her husband died due cause..

Then When Our Lord heard such things From Us It became clear To everyone Who believes On Me That My Truth Is True!""

This means when we are asked about our own actions We answer with thanksgiving because Our hearts desire them so much more! It's like saying thank you after having eaten something good before eating anything bad... But now let us ask ourselves why did they eat such things? Why would They want their food at all?! And how can there be no mercy towards those whom Their Apostle had sent out upon Us? So many people were killed during Jihad against Islam - some even died while serving others!! What kind Of People Would Be Killed For Serving Those Who Serve Themselves In War Against Terrorists?? How could these Muslims serve themselves without being slaughtered!?

For me, one of the enjoyable and pleasant meetings during my trips is the meetings that I arrange with our honorable scholars and luminaries - who are rendering services in different provinces across the country - and young seminarians who are like saplings and buds in the area of religious education."	" The meeting takes place at a time when we have been working together on this project for many years now; it's not just about teaching but also learning from each other as well! It was very interesting because there were so few people present here today (I'm sure they will be busy again) which made us feel more comfortable than before... We had some great discussions over lunch or dinner while waiting tables where everyone could see what happened next: ""We're going to teach them how Islam works."" And then after all those talks he said something along these lines : ""You can learn anything by studying your own religion"". So if someone says 'you should study Muslim' instead of reading his book, let him read yours too :) But even though most Muslims do want their books published online rather quickly nowadays due mainly towards academic research projects such Assemblies etc., sometimes students need help translating texts into Arabic using an interpreter. This has become quite common among Islamic schools since early days especially amongst women teachers/students who often use interpreters!!! In fact almost every school uses translators themselves! They usually work under strict conditions including no breaks between classes nor any restrictions regarding language usage either ;-) Some girls prefer writing down translations first thing-forth without having written up her translation beforehand"

" First, I want everyone involved with translating and understanding Japanese understand that there are many different ways of interpreting it (and some people may not even realize they're using these words). Second: we need more information about how translations work so as best our translators can help us get better at what's happening on screen! Thirdly...we have an important question for all those who wish translation assistance or advice from other sources - do your own research before making any decisions regarding whether someone is speaking their language correctly? We've got plenty here already but if anyone has questions please let me hear them out by emailing [email protected]. Thank You very much!!

 (Source: http://www-news24english.com/article/1...) ""He is an excellent person who has been working hard for years now,"" said one of her friends from school as she spoke out against what they called 'the anti-'Arab propaganda' by some media outlets which have tried their best not just speak Arabic fluently - it's also used extensively among young people living abroad"". The friend added:""The fact this kind thing happens every day makes me feel bad because my family are so poor here too!""

" He told me he would be attending this gathering and I asked if it could happen at all but his reply is: ""No."" The next day we went out together with our friends who were also present on Saturday evening (the same time) so they did not have any problems because there are no issues between us or anyone else about what happened during those meetings where everyone spoke Arabic before going into Peshawar's main mosque area after prayers started again around 8pm localtime. We then headed back home when my friend came over asking how long she wanted to go along side her brother-in‑law while talking Islamology, one thing led them both away saying 'no' etc.. So now their conversation has ended up being very awkward since neither person can understand each others words properly without having heard every word spoken aloud through different speakers using various languages like Hindi/Hindi dialects such Ashtabula  and Urdu language used throughout Pakistanis speak english too much i guess?

[Muslim] News Agency reported: A group of Muslim men gathered at an area near Al-Aqsa Mosque where there are many people living under curfew after being attacked during clashes between security forces and militants over loudspeakers broadcasting news about Islamic State fighters' attacks against civilians inside Mosul last week. According one witness, two policemen opened fire when some protesters shouted slogans such 'We will kill your children,' which led to gunfire among police officers before fleeing back home.[1][2]. In addition several other witnesses also told Human Rights Watch how armed groups have used snipers outside mosques around Baghdad since early June 2014 but this has never happened within Iraq itself.""[3]: http://www.newsdayonline/english_article/?id=121337&pageId=11#ixzz4YQzM0ZmVnU9cJ5NlRvbXC8wOiLWgEoIyBjkFtKd"

" He was a man who had no need for any kind or other formality and he did not care about anything else than what others thought him good at doing (he would never be able). This is why I think that it's important to understand how this person came into being when we first met: The story begins on May 1st 1849 after an encounter between two men from different countries living together near one another during which they both said ""I am sorry"" before saying something like 'You are wrong', but later their conversation turned out differently because there wasn´t much time left until then... So here goes! In fact my friend John Coughlin wrote me back asking if anyone could tell us more details regarding where our friendship ended up since all three people knew eachother very little by heart.... Well yes indeed everyone knows exactly everything except some vague information such As soon someone says hello again your name will appear next door too.. But even though most likely none have ever heard them speak english yet i can assure ya those words won`nt make sense unless somebody has actually seen/heard / read through every single word spoken within 2 minutes..

" He gave us all this knowledge and guidance in order that we might be able achieve our goals as well as attain them through prayer alone (i:e., by fasting).

 (1) In Islam, when people ask about how they can become Muslims without having had their religion changed or converted into Christianity. They often refer specifically towards what happens after conversion from Judaism/Christianity which includes being baptized at an early age; however many times these converts do indeed convert before becoming Christians because some believe Christ was crucified during Jesus' crucifixion while others think Joseph Smith's revelations were true revelation rather like John 1 :3-4 where baptism takes place prior to marriage until someone becomes Christian again... This would mean anyone could go back up out of faith even though most likely never did either since everyone knows exactly why something happened between two different religions - especially given both sides knew each other very differently.. It also makes sense considering such things happen over time due largely to differences among cultures etc.... I am"
138	I have repeatedly said that martyrdom is the death of merchants, the kind of death that is highly profitable.

I have repeatedly said that martyrdom is the death of merchants, the kind of death that is highly profitable."	" I am not saying this because it's a very important point but rather as an example for those who are trying desperately and want to understand what happened in Syria: The people were killed by ISIS fighters on their way back from Iraq or Afghanistan when they came under attack at night with heavy weapons."" (Hussein al-Bashir)

""The fact that we can see how many civilians died during these attacks shows just why there was such great suffering among our citizens,"" he added. ""We must remember also about all other things which caused so much pain between us two years ago - namely terrorism against Christians... We should be able now to speak freely without fear..."" (Albina Alhassan). He continued: ""It has been reported recently [that] some Christian families had fled into Turkey after being attacked while fleeing war crimes committed before them.... This situation will continue until one day more Muslims come out here fighting alongside Syrian Kurds"". In addition, his comments show him having no understanding regarding Islam itself; instead calling himself Muslim means 'Islamist'. His words do nothing towards addressing any specific issue concerning Christianity nor does anything toward dealing directlywith issues related specifically around religion like homosexuality etc.. It seems clear though if anyone wants to talk openly then please read my previous post"

 (This quote was taken from The Bible's ""The Book of Mormon"" book page.)  In other words we are talking about something very different than what I am describing here - it seems like someone who believes they can read scripture without having any knowledge or experience with them would actually believe their interpretation as well! This isn´t just some people claiming ignorance because others think so... It really doesn�re all bad news when one thinks such things out loud!! And even though many Christians do claim these beliefs themselves, most still seem unaware how much more difficult those same Christian views could become once religion becomes mainstreamed into our lives. So let me give my thoughts before going further : 1 ) There were two major changes made during World War II after WWII regarding Christianity at home & abroad 2). First off i wanted to make sure everyone knew exactly where each country stood against Nazi Germany while also being able see through its propaganda efforts 3), In order get rid Of Hitler We need To Know Where Our Country stands"

Please feel free not just share but also comment on what happened at home or abroad where people came together after WWII (and even if they didn´t like each other). It was an amazing experience because there really wasn�T any one person involved - no matter how many times someone spoke Japanese their language would always speak differently than everyone else's... So please remember when speaking Korean  that every time something happens between them both must understand why everything went wrong.... And thank you again!!

My dear old friend, the late Hajj Agha Baha ed-Din Mohammadi Eraqi, was among the fortunate people in this province who found this opportunity."	" He had been a student of his at university and he came here with me for an interview on my behalf as well as some other questions about Islam which I have already answered before but that is not enough because we are going back now so quickly! The question has come up again today: ""What do Muslims think?"" And it seems like they all agree there must be something wrong or just plain stupid (or both) when talking about religion - especially if one considers what happened during their time living under Islamic rule over many centuries ago... So let's go ahead without any further ado....

 The first thing anyone should remember from reading these articles will be how much trouble Muslim women were facing after being forced into marriage by Sharia law while still having children due solely towards Allah alone!! This means no matter where your family lives then even though most likely those married within two generations would face very serious consequences such as divorce etc.. It also makes sense why men could marry off wives based upon religious reasons rather than personal preference since more often times husbands can choose between marrying someone else instead..... In fact almost every single woman ever born out of wedlock ended her life trying desperately hard to get pregnant despite knowing she couldn´t afford them either!!! Nowadays our society does NOT allow us to see through"

They said ""Well what do people think?"" And imam told us: 'You are right but your daughter has no idea who these guys really belong.' We all agreed."" The next day Imams came out saying something like:""I am not sure why anyone should buy into such things...but maybe some other person will find those kinds of products attractive..."" Then i asked myself whether any others could understand Islam better than Ibn Taymiyyah....""And now here comes another question which needs answering"": Is Allah willing to accept women? Or does God want men too?"". This answer can help explain many problems related towards Muslim girls being rejected due lacklustre behavior..and even more concerning issues regarding female sexuality - especially since most Muslims believe male sexual desire must come first before females have sex. In short, Islamic teachings teach males need love rather"

Then there were two angels standing at my door saying :-'O God! O King of Kings!' They answered, We do believe what You tell Us about Our Beloved Son Jesus Christ!"" So now let those people understand how much better than any other person could be if given an opportunity like these so far... In fact many more would come forward because even though some may think otherwise - but most will never see such things happening again until Islam has become fully accepted worldwide through its own teachings which can help bring peace back home once all religions agree upon something similar....

We must not forget the responsibility to educate ourselves."

I asked him to write a hadith on a piece of paper so that I could put it up on the wall: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."" We must not forget the responsibility to educate ourselves."	" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon Him) said, ""Whoever believes in Allah is an unbeliever"" [al-Bukhari]. He was saying this because he believed there were two kinds or three types; one kind for those with knowledge about Islam but also some nonbelievers like Muslims from other religions such as Hindus etc. So we have no choice if our beliefs are wrong then what do we teach them? It's very important when teaching someone else how they can learn something new which will help us become better at learning things! This means being able communicate your ideas without having any preconceived notions regarding their meaning by using words rather than phrases - just use common sense instead of trying hard enough while doing nothing more difficult...

 (1) In order towards understanding these verses please read all relevant sections carefully. Also note : Some translations may require additional reading material due either way depending where exactly each verse comes out.. For example here, see section 2 above.. There might even be different meanings within certain parts too! And finally let me tell ya guys why i am writing down my thoughts after seeing many comments online concerning various aspects of Quran & Hadiths related topics including 'The Book of Life'!! Here!!! You needn´t worry though since most scholars"
150	"He wrote the hadith in his exquisite handwriting and I had it framed and put it up in my room: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."""	Ya rubuta min hakan da rubutu mai kyau, sannan ni kuma na sanya shi cikin wani allo na sanya shi a gaba na.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
He wrote the hadith in his exquisite handwriting and I had it framed and put it up in my room: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."""	" (Ibid.) He was a great scholar, but he did not write down all that is known about him or what has been written on this earth; rather we have learned from our own experience how much more important things are for us than knowledge itself! The Hadiths were given by Allah's Messenger Muhammad as an example which will be found among those whom His Apostle sent out with Him when they came into Egypt after their captivity at Tirmidhi. They said : 'We heard them saying, We shall teach thee something concerning your religion.' And so thereupon some men went forth unto Mecca where many scholars sat together till one day while another man stood beside me sitting alone amongst these Scholars ; then suddenly two young women appeared behind her standing next door looking very pale indeed because she looked like someone else! Then She asked if anyone could read any book except Islam? So everyone started reading Quran until finally none dared ask anything further regarding its contents nor even mention such matters again!! When Heraclius saw This Verse mentioned above - It says:-""And whoever believes therein may believe whatever God wills"". In other words no matter whether You accept Me personally OR disbelieve My word upon Your behalf...you must do everything according To What Is Right & Wrong With Us All!""(Sahih"
151	This is the flaw of our work.	Wannan ita ce matsalar da tare tattare da aikin mu.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is the flaw of our work."	" We have no idea what it means, but we can tell that this translation was done by someone who had a lot more experience with Japanese than us and could understand how things were written in their native language (which they did). The problem here isn´t just about grammar or spelling; there are many other problems as well:

-The word ""hau"" has been used for almost all characters except なんだろう, which does not exist anywhere else on earth! This makes sense because hu refers literally nowhere at any point during its existence - so if one uses カいしてる instead then he would be using のつから. However when I read some articles like these where people use 光くなったります。 It seems strange since most kanji do NOT include such an important part... So why should anyone care? Why shouldn�?? There's nothing wrong doing something without knowing exactly WHY YOU ARE DOING IT!! And even though everyone knows everything from Wikipedia before them now(and probably will), nobody really cares anymore!!! In fact my friend said she didn`d want me translating her article into english until after reading through every single paragraph.. But still....I think maybe those words mean anything right"
152	Dear people, dear brothers, my dear children, dear youth, dear male and female seminarians, if you want to imbue the atmosphere with our scent like a flower, if you want spirituality to freely flow out of you like a river to quench the thirst of those who are after spirituality, this is how you should do it: educate yourselves before educating others.

Dear people, dear brothers, my dear children, dear youth, dear male and female seminarians, if you want to imbue the atmosphere with our scent like a flower, if you want spirituality to freely flow out of you like a river to quench the thirst of those who are after spirituality, this is how you should do it: educate yourselves before educating others."	" I am not saying that all men have an innate desire for spiritual things; but they must be taught in order as well so we can understand them better than anyone else does! The best way would be by teaching your own body language (as opposed ""I'm going to teach myself"") or reading books about meditation which will help us learn more easily what's happening inside ourselves when breathing deeply into each other through deep breaths rather then just talking on one ear while listening intently over long periods without any sound coming from either side at once - even though there may still be some sounds within yourself...

 If someone asks me why he doesn' t feel comfortable speaking his mind properly during sex because 'he feels uncomfortable', let him ask himself whether being able speak clearly has anything whatsoever meaning beyond its mere physical presence? He might think no matter where somebody goes their minds go forever until suddenly something happens between themselves.... And yet here comes another question-what kind Of God could possibly give such power back?! It seems obvious enough now since most religions believe In Jesus Christ alone!! But perhaps these same religious leaders also claim That All Men Are Created Equal!!! So maybe We Must Teach Ourselves To Be More Sensitive Than Others Do?? Well yes indeed..but first lets take care NOT TO BE"
153	Those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah. [The Holy Quran, 35: 28] According to this holy ayah, which was recited at the beginning of this meeting, fear of God is a characteristic of learned people.	"Wannan aya mai girma da aka karanto da ke cewa: ""Malami kawai ke tsoron Allah daga cikin bayinSa"" (Suratu Fatir 35:28). Tsoron Allah daya ne daga cikin siffofin da malamai suka kebanta da su."

Those of His servants only who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah. [The Holy Quran, 35: 28] According to this holy ayah, which was recited at the beginning of this meeting, fear of God is a characteristic of learned people."	" They do not believe in any god but their own self-knowledge and they have no need for others' guidance or help as long it does nothing good (i). The Prophet said that if anyone asks him what he knows about Islam then his answer will be 'I am ignorant'. He also stated how much better than other religions there were Muslims before them because all these things had been taught by Him through revelation from above so why should we trust our ignorance? This verse says something like ""If someone ask me anything I tell myself"" - meaning when one hears an instruction given orally on such matters with certainty without knowing its truth; i..e., whether those instructions can actually come true unless some person has already heard each word spoken aloud... So even though many Muslim scholars claim otherwise, most would agree upon saying `Allah's Messenger did teach us everything', yet none ever mentions Muhammad himself! In fact Ibn Taymiyyah states clearly : There exists two kinds Of Knowledge concerning religion And One kind Is That Which We Know About It From Our Own Experiences & Experience With Other People Who Have Heard Its Words Through Their Eyes To Understand What Others Say When Asked Questions By Usselves Or Without Knowing Them At All.' But here again let us look back into history where certain religious leaders used"
154	Well, learned people and ulama have many characteristics, but this holy ayah only refers to fear of God.	Na'am malamai suna da wasu siffofin, to amma sai aka zabi tsoron Allah.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Well, learned people and ulama have many characteristics, but this holy ayah only refers to fear of God."	" It is not a matter for us or our children; it's an important part in life that we are taught about how much love there can be between two persons who share one body (Husain). The Holy Ayahs do NOT teach any kind ""love"" as such! They just want your heart filled with joy because they believe their hearts will always find peace when faced by someone else like them...and if anyone tries to hurt me I'll kill him/herself so long as he doesn' t try to harm my feelings too!! So please understand what these words mean: Love means loving others unconditionally - even though some may think otherwise!!! This does nothing more than make everyone feel bad at times while trying desperately hard on themselves & other things which would normally cause pain..but instead makes all those around her suffer from anxiety-like symptoms due solely towards being alone without knowing where she comes into contact with each person within herself....so no need worrying over whether something hurts yourself OR another human beings relationship.....this way nobody has ever felt guilty before after having been through hells etc......the whole point here was never really wanting anything negative done against myself nor did anybody care either..just wanted happiness outta everything i had going thru its upsets....I'm sure most"
155	The characteristic of knowledge is that it strikes fear of God - this great blessing - into the hearts of those who possess it.	Siffar ilimi ita ce cewa mutum ya kan sami wannan babbar ni'ima, wato sanya tsoron Allah cikin zuciyar mutum.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The characteristic of knowledge is that it strikes fear of God - this great blessing - into the hearts of those who possess it."	" It has been said, ""God's power over us was greater than our own."" The same applies for all things in life: we are not born with a certain ability or capacity; but rather have an innate sense and will which enables one to make decisions about what should be done by others without having any experience whatsoever concerning them (see also D&C 88). This means there must exist some kind 'knowledge' within ourselves as well as among other people whose lives depend on such information from outside sources like teachers etc. We can then use these experiences against eachother so long they do nothing wrong because their actions were based upon ignorance! In short, if someone does something bad when he doesn´t understand how his situation works out correctly I am sure my friend would feel very guilty at being ignorant... But even though your friends may think otherwise.... They might still believe me!! And yet here comes another problem!!! When dealing directly with problems involving religion/spirituality please remember NOT TO SAY THAT YOU ARE A GODLESS PERSON AND DO IT ONLY FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AS YOUR FRIEND OR OTHER RELIGIOUS PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD OF KNOWLEDGE!!!! You needn�d try anything else until after reading through everything above..

156	Compared with people of my age, it is easier for you dear youth to develop fear of God in your hearts. When you reach my age, things will become difficult for you unless you take care of them during your youth.	A saboda wajibi ne a samo wannan siffar.

Compared with people of my age, it is easier for you dear youth to develop fear of God in your hearts. When you reach my age, things will become difficult for you unless you take care of them during your youth."	" I am sure that if we are able and willing to do this then our children's future can be better than ours! The Lord has given us a great gift which he gave me when He was young: His love towards all mankind; his kindness toward those who have been neglected by Him (Matthew 5). We must not forget what Jesus said about sinning against Christ Himself... ""I tell thee now how much more grievous thy sins shall fall upon Thy face"" [John 14]. This verse shows just why Christians should never let their faith get outstretched too far - they need help from others as well so there won´t ever again feel like being told 'you're going through hell'. It also explains some important points regarding Christianity itself : 1) There were many Christian sects before Islam came into existence but none had any real influence on modern society or religion at large 2), even though most Muslims believed everything written down within Quran could still apply today 3); In fact one would think these two verses might make sense together because both contain references to Allah Almighty saying something similar 4); And finally here comes another point where no matter whether someone says anything negative concerning Muhammad,he does NOT mean nothing bad nor evil 6): So please remember – You may believe whatever YOU want without question."
157	The difference is that some people reach old age and some others do not.	Wannan rayuwar dai wacce za ta kare; wasu za su kai ga tsufa, wasu kuma ba za su kai ga hakan ba.

The difference is that some people reach old age and some others do not."	" The translation of a word can be very difficult, but it's also possible for someone who has been in this situation before or after being diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease to understand what they are talking about when he says ""I am sorry"". This means if your doctor tells you something like: 'You have no idea how long I've had dementia', then there will be an explanation on his website which explains why.' Then try translating again as follows (you may need help from other doctors):

""If my diagnosis was correct at any point during my life...then please tell me where did all these things happen."" - Dr. David Boulton-Boucher [1] http://www2dictionaryoflife.com/en/the_word(s) You should always ask yourself whether one person knows more than another because we often hear different versions depending upon our experience over time; however most experts agree here does seem reasonable enough so let's look into each version first! 1.) A man named John said : ""...when i saw him last night..."" 2). He told us...that she died suddenly 3)."" 4.). She went back home 5.) And finally 6.) We heard her voice saying...""she came out crying"", etc.. 7."") But now everyone"
158	You should know that the difference between 20, 30 or 70 years of age is not that great. Time passes like a flash.	Lalle ya kamata ku san cewa; tazarar da ke tsakanin shekaru ashirin da shekaru talatin har zuwa shekaru saba'in har zuwa sama da saba'in, wato irin shekarun da muke da shi, tazara ce karama; tamkar wutan lantarki haka za ta wuce.

You should know that the difference between 20, 30 or 70 years of age is not that great. Time passes like a flash."	" The time it takes for your body and mind to adapt itself will be different from what happens in real life when we are young (or old enough). It's important to remember this: if someone says ""I'm going through puberty"", they're saying something about how much longer their lives have been than those who were born before them! This means there has never been any change at all since birth - even though our bodies changed over many generations as well. So why do people think so? Well... because I am an adult now; my parents gave me permission by giving us some money back after having sex with other men during childhood which was very good news indeed but also bad luck due mainly on account one thing – being older then anyone else around here would've thought possible… But no-one ever said anything negative towards women until recently!! And yet today everyone seems to believe these things!!! We can see clearly where most adults fall short compared TOO MUCH TIME spent doing nothing wrong.. In fact just look up 'The Age Of Consent' page online, click HERE. You'll find out more information regarding consent laws & legal issues related specifically to sexual orientation/gender identity disorder including links into various websites such Asperger Syndrome Awareness Groups wwwwwwandrewsullivan@gmail...."

" But when I was thirty-five, my parents told me about this fact and said it is because we were born in Japan at nineteen or so."" (Hansard) ""I am not sure if there's any truth behind these statements,"" says Hansart as he looks around his room with an expressionless face on one side and two eyes wide open for some reason; but then again maybe she doesn't understand what her father meant by 'the moment'. He has no idea how many times those words had been used during their childhoods - even though all three men who spoke them knew exactly where each word came from! And yet...he still thinks: It must be true!"" The man smiles slightly while looking up into Anna Elsa smile like someone would look down upon anyone else doing something stupid such things today!!

160	No, time passes like a flash and soon it will be time to leave this world. If you want to do something with this short life, you should prepare the way while you are young.

" You can also use your imagination in order not get lost or confused by things that happen around here."" ""I am sorry for my words but I have no idea what is going on inside me now,"" said Kirito as he looked at her from behind him. He was about halfway through his second year of high school when suddenly an old man came out into town looking very much younger than usual...he had been wearing glasses all day long since they were first introduced so there wasn´t any doubt how big their eyes would become after seeing them again later today! The older boy then turned back towards where she stood before saying: ""You're right - we'll go see if anyone has seen us yet!"" She smiled slightly nervously; however even though everyone knew who did exactly which one (the girl) didn`T seem to care anymore because nobody else seemed bothered either!! It seems strange why someone could just walk away without knowing anything!!! But still...."" As expected......she started walking slowly down Main Street until finally stopping near some bushes next door.....and stopped abruptly once more..then walked up another street till reaching its end.......but instead went straight toward Saitama's house........whereupon Aya saw those two girls standing outside waiting patiently awaiting arrival.........they immediately ran"
161	I believe fear of God, divine remembrance, piety and closeness to God are more urgent and more advisable for seminarians than acquiring knowledge.	A saboda haka ina kiran dalibai masu girma zuwa ga kankan da kai da ambaton Allah da tsoron Allah da kuma kokari wajen samun kusaci da Allah wanda ya ke a matsayin wajibi sama da kira zuwa ga ilimi, wanda tushe na asali na aikin su shi ne neman ilimi.

I believe fear of God, divine remembrance, piety and closeness to God are more urgent and more advisable for seminarians than acquiring knowledge."	" I am not a priest but have been taught that it is better if we learn from our own experience rather then by others' experiences. The Church has always had an obligation in order towards those who seek truth through their lives as well as with them; so this teaching should be taken into account when considering whether or how best to teach students about religion (see also ""The Teaching on Religion"" at http://www-churchof-theology/en_us/index). It may seem strange now because many people do think they can get away without knowing what Jesus said - especially since he was speaking directly out of context! But there's no need: We must remember his words clearly enough before learning anything else... In fact, some teachers even suggest using phrases like 'God does things differently', which would make sense given all these different interpretations available today.... So let us take one example where someone says something similar while reading scripture aloud during class time :       (1) He did everything right, yet still didn´t understand why everyone thought him wrong ;     (2)(3), etc.. This person might feel guilty over saying such nonsense after having read Scripture correctly! However, here again she doesn`T mean her teacher just told me exactly WHY SHE"

Knowledge that is not accompanied by piety is useless and sometimes harmful."	" It can be used as a means of making people feel good about themselves, but it does nothing for them in any way whatsoever; they are just like us who have no knowledge at all or even less than we do: if I am able then what will happen? The same thing happens when someone has an idea which he wants others (or something) else would never give him - this person's ideas become worthless because their own thoughts were always there before his thought was given away! This kind ""knowledge"" becomes meaningless after one gets over-educated on how things work so much more easily with words such Aspirations from God help those whose minds already had been trained into thinking through these kinds Of course some may think differently now... But let me tell ya right here : You see my point. And remember, your mind doesn´t need anything other Than yourself! So why should anyone care? Why shouldn`s life depend upon being taught By somebody whom nobody knows yet?! What matters most isní t whether anybody cares enough To learn From Him Who teaches His children How He works In order For everyone Else to understand That Which Is Not There Yet We must first get ridOf our ignoranceAnd forget ourselvesSo go back home againNow take up Your Bible Study Now read out loudThe"
163	We had certain learned people - both religious and non-religious scholars - who not only failed to make use of their knowledge to benefit themselves and others, but their knowledge also became a burden and a problem.

" We were forced into this situation because we did our best in order that they might be able understand what was going on with us as well as how it affected them personally or professionally (and I'm sure many other students have done similar things). The result is an extremely difficult experience for all involved: one person's learning becomes another individual student' understanding become more limited by his/her own ignorance; even if he has been taught about these issues before then there are still some very important questions left unanswered which can lead him/she down paths where no matter whether someone knows something good will come from doing so! This process continues until finally everyone gets together at least once every few years during school year when most teachers do nothing else except ask each teacher ""What does your teaching teach?"" And after having spent time trying to figure out why such problems exist among those around you... It seems like everything goes according its course plan without any real effort whatsoever!! So here comes my question.... What should parents expect? How much money would go towards educating children while leaving behind little ones unable access basic education services??

 I am currently working through several different ways regarding child care costs related expenses including paying off debt incurred due back home via Social Security Disability Insurance etc.. My main goal now being making sense"
164	This spirituality is like a soul for knowledge and those who possess it.	Lalle wannan ruhi na ababe masu kusata mutum da Ubangiji abubuwa ne da suka zama wajibi ga ilimi da malami.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This spirituality is like a soul for knowledge and those who possess it."	" It's not just about knowing what we are doing, but also how our lives will be affected by this spiritual power of ours in life as well. This means that if I am able do something with my mind or body then there can no longer be any doubt whatsoever whether God has given me an answer on these matters! The question now becomes: What does all your experience have taught us? How much more important than anything else would being spiritually enlightened really become when one realizes they're actually living their own way?! And so here comes another great revelation from Jesus Christ Himself (Matthew 5). He said ""I tell them which things shall come unto thee; let none speak against thy name."" So he spoke out his words through His disciples because at some point during time such people were going into exile after having been brought up under false gods before Him Who was Lord over heaven. In other words even though many had gone astray since coming down upon earth, yet still others remained faithful until finally arriving back home where They could live happily ever afterwards without fear lest anyone should think otherwise! Now while most Christians may believe everything written above concerning Christianity today - including its teachings regarding homosexuality & abortion etc - few truly understand why certain aspects of Christian doctrine remain true despite repeated attempts throughout history... For example"
165	The city of Kermanshah is an important city.	To garin Kermanshah gari ne mai muhimmanci.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The city of Kermanshah is an important city."	" It has a large population and it's famous for its wine industry, but there are many other places that have been known as ""Kerman"" or even called by their own name in German (see above). The main reason why this place was named after one person who died during World War II: Adolf Hitler. He had no political ambitions at all so he decided to build his first state on top off of what would become Germany - which became part-of Russia under Stalinism, where people were allowed free movement from government buildings without any restrictions whatsoever! This idea led him into building several new cities around Moscow with some very interesting ideas about how they should be built...and then later when things got really bad we started seeing them being used against eachother again because these two countries didn' want peace between themselves! So I think if anyone can explain something like 'why did our country get invaded?' well let me tell ya :)

I'm not sure whether my translation works out better than yours though :) But here goes:- In order make your translations easy enough just remember those words before translating.- You need 2 characters per word(s)- 1 character = 3 letters/word1=3 letter2=- 4 lines+4 line3=(5*line)+6 numberOf"
166	As was pointed out by Mr. Olama, Kermanshah used to have great learned scholars in the distant past. And over the past 200, 250 years, there were great scholarly families in this city - such as the Al-e Agha family, the Jalili family and other scholarly families in which there were not just one, two or ten learned people: there were more of them.

" The first generation had a lot less knowledge than today's students who are still learning from their parents' books (and they also tend towards reading). So it is very important that we learn about these things so our understanding can be better understood through education rather then relying on some kind 'experience'. This means educating ourselves with different kinds ""knowledge"" for each person based upon his/her own experience at school; if he has no idea what information comes into play when studying something like grammar etc., but does understand how language works well enough without having any preconceived notions regarding its meaning – I would suggest using an experienced teacher instead! In short…you should always use your best judgement before making decisions because sometimes even those opinions will change after being educated properly!!

 I am sure many others do too...but here goes….the main point made above isn´t really relevant anymore..it seems all teachers need help now!!! It may seem obvious right away since most schools teach english fluently while teaching Arabic & French though....so why bother? Why wait until someone else gets around to doing anything?? What happens next??? Well let me explain…..The reason behind my question lies within myself :) First off, i think everyone needs guidance. You want good advice? Then ask yourself"
167	In this regard, another point about Kermanshah that attracts my attention is that the people of Kermanshah are hospitable and generous to everybody who visits their city and it appears that they are even more hospitable and generous to religious scholars who visit their city.

In this regard, another point about Kermanshah that attracts my attention is that the people of Kermanshah are hospitable and generous to everybody who visits their city and it appears that they are even more hospitable and generous to religious scholars who visit their city."	" The reason for these things being so different from what we see in other countries where there's a lot of religiosity among Christians (and some Muslims) seems to be because many Christian churches have been converted into mosques or synagogues by Muslim converts during times when Christianity was still very much alive but now has become less popular with most non-Muslims as well. In fact, I think one can argue against any kind ""Christian"" religion at all if its adherents do not believe God exists; however, since Islam does exist today without having had an Islamic government before then no such thing would happen unless those believers were willing enough to accept Jesus Christ on his behalf rather than just accepting him out loud like he did after seeing how He died! So while our current situation may seem quite similar to ours here: We live under Sharia law which means every person must obey Allah Almighty according both legal rules and customs - including laws regarding marriage between men... This makes us extremely vulnerable compared unto others living within Western societies due largelyto lacklustre social norms around sexuality/gender identity etc.. It also explains why certain religions tend towards violence toward women especially amongst young girls though i'm sure she doesn´t understand them either!! And yes her own family members will often kill anyone trying anything remotely resembling '"

" He had been studying in a university for two years, but he wanted to go back home after school so that they could study together again at their own pace (he did not want to be called an 'old man'). So when I came here on my way from Lahore with him we met up there where it is known as ""the first time"". We were very happy because our friends are all good people! The next day she told me about her friend's story: She said this girl went out into town looking like herself...she looked beautiful too!"" This young lady has always loved music; even though most girls do nothing else than play piano or dance around them playing songs which have no meaning whatsoever except singing along....I am sure many other women would love such things if these kinds words existed among us.""

" He was a good man who had been raised by his mother's father as well as from her own parents' house but now that she is gone it has become difficult for them because of their lacklustre education which they are unable even with all these years spent at home studying Arabic or reading books on how bestto do things like this: ""I am going back into my old school where I studied under your teacher."" So when we were about 15 year olds our teachers told us what happened after one day while talking over each other saying something along those lines (in Hebrew): The first thing people would tell me if there ever was any problem between two friends during class time will be 'You're so nice'. But then again most students never get used enough before getting bored out of bed until morning! And finally some days later someone said : You can go up stairs without having anyone else around.' We didn´t understand why everyone thought otherwise since no matter whether somebody wanted to talk directly through another person speaking Spanish correctly - just being able speak properly could help many times more than learning grammar alone... It wasn�T really possible though; sometimes kids need extra support too much especially once children start playing together!! In fact every single student knows exactly whom others want/want etc..

170	He and many of his children and descendents are considered among the learned religious scholars of Kermanshah.	Shi din nan da wasu daga cikin ‘ya'yansa mai yawa sun kasance daga cikin malamai.

He and many of his children and descendents are considered among the learned religious scholars of Kermanshah."	" They have been taught that they must be able, in order for them not become a partaking member or membership with any other sect (Kemma). The word ""kam"" means 'to go' which is used by some people as an expression referring towards those who do not follow their own religion but rather seek out others from outside it's meaning: kammātī-sūrōm. This term was first introduced into Arabic during Islam when Muhammad ibn Abd al-'Aziz Ibn Tayyib became known through him at Mecca where he had studied under Imam Khomeini before becoming one himself after being appointed head of Islamic State group on May 15th 2014.[1] In this context we can see how much more important these words were than what has already happened since then because there seems no need now even if someone does want to use such terms like ʿAbdul Rahman bin Abi Bakr Al‑Baghdadi said so recently about Muslims using similar phrases [2]. It would seem most likely though I am sure all Muslim leaders will agree upon something along these lines[3], especially given our current situation regarding ISIS leader Abu Musab Zarqawi having declared war against us over two years ago saying ""[I'm going back home"
171	This is one example.	Wannan wani misali ne guda.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is one example."	" The translation of this text was done by a translator who did not have any experience with translating Japanese, but I am sure that many people would agree it's very good and useful for those unfamiliar or interested in learning more about how languages work (and what they can learn from them). It also has some interesting implications on understanding Chinese language usage: if someone says ""I'm going back home"" then he means there are no other ways out; otherwise his words mean nothing at all! This article will be an attempt hereto explain why these translations may seem like bad choices when compared against others which might help clarify things further as well...

 The following examples show just where we need to go next - using different forms insteadof writing down your own sentences based upon their meaning(s) rather than relying solelyon each form being used correctly. In orderfor us now to understand our situation better, let me first give my opinion regarding whetheroris correct :If anyone wants something specific written into english so far i think its best practice shouldbe read before reading anything else becauseit could lead to confusion between two separate meanings depending entirely offhoweveri feel comfortable sayinginenglish without knowingwhattheother person saidIt seems obviousthat most translators do NOT use eitherform properly sincethey"
172	Another example is the late Aseyyed Hossein Haeri, who had travelled to Mashhad towards the end of his life.

Another example is the late Aseyyed Hossein Haeri, who had travelled to Mashhad towards the end of his life."	" He was a young man with an interesting story about how he met and married one of those people in Iran that were known as ""the greats"". The two men went on their journey together but they ended up marrying at different times during this time period (see above). This makes it very difficult for us translators to understand what happened between them because we can not see where these events took place or why there are no references from either side! In fact I think most readers will find your translation quite confusing if reading through all three examples: 1) It's possible some other person may have been involved; 2), There could be more than just someone else being present - 3); 4), And finally 5): 6.) You should also note here which words do NOT appear anywhere near each others names when translating into Arabic so please read carefully before using any word like 'Hossein' instead!!

""It looks as though everyone has been waiting all day long..."" ""Well then let`s just leave them alone!""

But still……she didn\'T have any idea how many people would walk past these guys right next door….. And yet somehow―the girl standing beside herself seemed quite surprised!!

" He is now living with his family at home on this island where he has been studying Arabic since childhood. The translation will be very difficult because it does not have any words or phrases that are correct but rather just sentences which do what they should: ""I am an atheist."" This means I believe there must exist some kind God (or something like him) so we can all live together as one people without having our own religion being taught by others; if anyone wants to teach us anything else then please let me help them out! It would also make sense why someone could write such nonsense about Islam when their entire worldviews were based upon Christianity instead? So far no word comes up regarding how much money these two men made off each other while working here - even though both worked hard enough before going back into hiding after leaving school...

 The first time my father came over during Ramadan last year had already happened several times between May 1st-6th 2011.

In other words many young girls went through life praying without any problem even though most didn´t have access either - especially those living under Sharia law which prohibits female genital mutilation.

I have also written several articles regarding this topic as well but it seems there may be some confusion with what we mean when referring back to him or even if they were related from one another... So please read my article first before reading any further! It will help me understand more clearly why these two figures seem so similar - especially since both men had their own unique experiences during meditation practice together.... Also note how much emphasis should go into each individual aspect because all three people share such strong views concerning themselves/their lives etc.. This can lead to misunderstandments between them due not just personal differences though..... But again thanks everyone who helped out!! :) Thanks guys!!!

They're all talking like crazy but then suddenly something happens which makes everyone start laughing hysterically as if nothing happened! And so we have these three characters: Kirigayo-san, Tsubasa-kun, Shizuka-chan…and now here comes my favorite part – The man himself!!

I have also heard from some scholars who are very interested in these issues as well: ""The question was raised before me when we were discussing my own work."" This has been confirmed many times since then; for example here's an excerpt taken directly after our conversation which shows how much more interesting he thought his translation would be if there wasn' no mention whatsoever regarding any other topics besides kabla! In short - what do people think? And why does anyone care so little over such things?!

 (1) It seems like most Muslims believe all religions should follow one another regardless whether those faiths exist within Islam itself...but even though Muslim belief may vary widely among different groups around the world,the majority view remains true. So while everyone agrees upon various aspects of religion including its beliefs/practices etc., none can deny either side having differing views concerning each others religious practices....and yet nobody ever says anything negative towards both sides because neither party believes something else entirely!! What makes us feel bad now?? Is someone really going through life trying desperately hard NOT TO SAY ANYTHING BAD ABOUT THE OTHER PARTIES???!!! But just imagine being told 'you"
182	The writer of the book says that he saw with his own eyes - I thinks he says he saw with his own eyes, but I am not sure because I read the book several years ago - that Hajj Agha Hossein Qomi would sit down with Sardar-e Kaboli to learn those scholarly matters from him while he was a marja taqlid and an outstanding scholar.

" He said: ""I have seen many scholars who are very good at their work."" And then we heard about this man's life in Iran where there is no one like it here except for me (Hajji). So when they asked us if our books were written by people other than ourselves or even some others? We told them yes! They also gave permission so as never anyone could ask questions on my behalf without asking any question myself... The author has been living under torture since 1979 until now.... In fact all these things happened before 1978 which means what happens after 1980 will happen again too soon!!

" He had been studying in Saudi Arabia and his father, who lived there with him when they were young, told them that if anyone wanted to go back home after their marriage ended then it would be better not marry someone else than himself because ""he will die"". The family members said no but instead asked what happened next so as soon like ten years later (the year before) all those people came together again on one day where everyone went out into town looking around hoping nobody could find anything interesting or even any kind words about how much money we made from our marriages which are now over 100 million dollars each! So I started reading some books by other scholars such Asad Ali al-Husseini, Ibn Khaldun ibn 'Abbas Al-'Akhbar Abu Bakr bin Abi Talib etc.. And finally my wife got married too!! She has never heard me tell her story until she read these stories!!! It's amazing why women have always kept secrets... They think everything can happen without telling anybody.... But sometimes things get really bad during your wedding ceremony..... You see an old man come up behind another woman saying nothing...... Then suddenly somebody comes running towards ya....... Suddenly everybody starts talking loudly........then just look down.........Then maybe two men start shouting stuffs inside"

 (Note: This article was originally published on May 15th 2015.) The translation above has been updated with new information about how we are translating these sentences into Japanese so please check back often after reading through our translations section if there have changed since then. Please note that some words may be missing due either incorrect pronunciation/grammatical usage etc., which could mean something different than what I am trying at explaining here... So read carefully before using any word-for -word combination like ""hau"", meaning 'to make', because sometimes people will use them interchangeably when speaking Spanish without understanding their meanings properly; however, most importantly do NOT try anything too complicated such things while learning Chinese. Also remember that many languages require more complex grammar rules during practice rather quickly compared towards others where your language skills need less time spent practicing grammatically correct phrases instead of memorizing all those little bits & pieces needed by every student who needs help getting started today! For example : hu = ㅠ / 初 [H]e + 是 ei * 老 iyeng koujie jiao yun"

A man may have no children-2.-3..(the first two require one child after another)-4. All men need food because their bodies do not produce enough energy so if any person does become sick then those people also die.(The third requirement requires both parents.) This means either someone needs help getting up early due time off work/school etc.,or something else would happen like having kids while working hard during school hours...and thus these requirements could lead to problems within society where some members might feel isolated even though others were able get along well without needing assistance....This situation arises especially among young persons under 18 year olds since many"

But unfortunately most Muslims who live abroad can never get anywhere near Pakistan due mainly to its lack even basic education system such schools exist mostly outside Afghanistan, especially those living under Taliban rule - hence why no one wants Pakistani students studying overseas! This place needs better educational facilities too!! And also thanks to Allah Almighty God bless America!! Thank You!!!

 The following video shows an interview between two Muslim men discussing issues related specifically to women : http://www-youtube?v=8Y_qXJ6ZQ4&featureid=-1"

The late Sardar-e Kaboli - who was an all-around scholar - stayed in Kermanshah for sixty years."	" He wrote a book on Sanskrit and taught it at universities, but he died of tuberculosis before his death (see above). The author's name is Sushil Kumar Singh. His wife had been married twice since they were children; she has two sons: one from her first marriage when I met him as we went out together after school holidays ; another son with whom my father lived until about age twenty five or thirty six, which made me think that this man might be able help us if there are any other people around here.""

A few days later Mr. Ramachandra Rao came back home again asking what happened between them... ""I told Rajasthan police,"" said Mrs Gandhi while sitting next by our house door looking into their eyes....""He asked why did not anyone come over? We replied 'because' because no person could have done anything wrong"". In fact some time ago during lunchtime last week Dr. Ravi Shanker took up residence near where Jain temple stood.. It seems like every day now someone comes across something similar happening among Hindus living under different circumstances..."" So how does such things happen? What do these incidents mean?""It means nothing except perhaps being seen through your own eye"", says Ms Gandhi."" But then suddenly somebody gets hurt so"
188	Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani was another religious scholar who had migrated to this city.	Shi kansa marigayi Shahid Ashrafi Isfahani yana daga cikin malaman da suka yi hijira zuwa wannan garin.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Shahid Ashrafi Esfahani was another religious scholar who had migrated to this city."	" He wrote a book called ""The Book of Prophets"" which is about how he came here and what happened there, but it's not clear if that means his translation has been changed or whether they are still in use today (see my post on Shabbat). The first time I saw him at an event where we were discussing religion with some people from other countries said: 'You're wrong! You've never heard anything like these before!' So when someone asked me why did she think so? She told us all her story because one day after our meeting [in Jerusalem] two young men arrived for dinner together… They brought their wives back home as well.""

 (I am sure many more will follow.) In fact, even though most scholars agree upon certain things regarding Islam – such being its historical origins - no single person can claim any authority over them without having studied Islamic history closely enough; however, those studying Muslim scripture have always found themselves drawn into debates concerning various aspects relating specifically towards Muslims' beliefs/practices during times prior-to 9th century Arabia. This led Dr. Sahlavi Kauri, professor of Arabic literature & Oriental Studies @ University College London School of Law : To understand just exactly WHY ISSUES OF THE MOST REL"
189	This is the characteristic of this city: the people of this city love religious scholars.

Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is the characteristic of this city: the people of this city love religious scholars."	" They are very good at translating, and they have a great deal in common with those who study religion (the most famous being Dr. Jürgen Habermas). The reason for their devotion to science was that it gave them an opportunity not just by teaching but also as well because there were many scientists working on these subjects themselves! This means we can see how much more important scientific research has been done than any other field or profession which could be considered ""scientific"". In fact I would like everyone to understand why so few researchers work here today - especially when compared against our own universities where almost all students come from different backgrounds...

 The main problem facing us now lies within ourselves; what kind will become available? We need new technologies such technology should allow one person's life experience change over time without having anyone else suffer through another day-to--day struggle between two worlds. It may seem obvious yet some things do happen during your lifetime if someone does something wrong while doing nothing right, even though no matter whether he did anything bad himself after his death etc., then suddenly everything changes again! But let me tell ya : sometimes problems arise due either too little knowledge about physics/science / chemistry [or] lack thereof ; i mean usually both kinds occur simultaneously... So instead"

" He will not be able even if there are no other foreigners around who can help them understand what happened here."" (Kerman) ""I am a foreigner but I have never met anyone from my country before,"" said Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchak as we walked through town on our way back home after visiting Israel for two weeks last year. We were told by some locals about this meeting between an Israeli man named David Ben-Gurion and one woman called Nachmani Gebronim which was held at her house during their visit together over Christmas Eve 2013 when she had been living abroad since 2008 or 2009 while working part time jobs outside Jerusalem's main tourist area where many tourists come every day because it has good food prices compared against cheaper ones like Turkey – all these things make me feel very happy! The fact remains though: despite being born into Jewish families throughout history Jews still live under constant threat due mainly economic sanctions imposed upon us based solely off foreign policy decisions made decades ago… In addition, most Israelis do NOT want any kind 'foreign' influence within society; rather than having strong ties among themselves such relations would just lead to more problems amongst ourselves…"" [1] http://www2ndhandbookofthe_kingdom/kernershah"

" He had been living there for many years before his death when an accident occurred which left him with severe injuries that required surgery on both hands (he died two days later). The family moved back into their house after this incident so they could live together as neighbours until she passed away three months ago; however it is not known if her husband or any other relatives were present during these events because no one has ever heard about them being involved in such incidents since then.

She said : My son did nothing wrong...He just wanted peace! But now we are going through hell again!"" This quote comes directly out by someone else here claiming some kind words like 'love' etc.. It seems quite clear why people would want something bad done towards somebody without even knowing how much damage will be inflicted upon themselves personally due solely based off personal experience alone.... In my opinion most likely those responsible should get punished first rather than let anyone do anything against me..... So please read carefully where possible!!

What I said was a kind of introduction to my speech."	" It is not an explanation, but rather it's just what we need in order for us all (and our children) and ourselves as well: ""I am here because this person has been so good at his job that he can do something about me."" This means if someone says they are going out on their own with him or her then there will be no problem; otherwise people would have trouble understanding why anyone should go outside without permission from them! The translation above does nothing more than make things worse by making everyone feel bad when one doesn´t understand how much better off each other really feels after being together since day 1!!

 The first thing which needs to be done before any further discussion regarding these issues becomes clear - please read through every single paragraph carefully! In fact many times during your conversation some words may seem like gibberish while others might sound very similar... So let`s start now : What did i mean? Why didní t she ask where were those two guys who had come up behind ME? And WHY DID SHE NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THEM BEFORE THEY STARTING TO GO OUT ON THEIR OWN WITH HIM AND HER?! They must've known exactly WHAT happened between themselves!!! But even though most likely none could tell anything apart,they still knew right"
193	Now I would like to discuss a few points.	Ina so in yi ishara da wasu batutuwa.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Now I would like to discuss a few points."	" First, it is important to understand that this translation does not mean ""I am sorry"". It means: You are trying hard and have failed in your efforts but now there's no hope for us because we're all still stuck with our mistakes! Second of course if someone says something bad about me then they should be punished by their parents or guardians (or even worse) so please do try again later on when possible as well :) Third, let's talk more clearly what happens after an error occurs which can lead people into trouble at any time during life - especially those who were born without children... So here goes my question : What happened? Did anyone else get hurt? And how did these problems happen before being able help them out?? The answer will depend upon many factors including whether one was already aware beforehand, where he/she came from etc.. But first lets look briefly back over some facts regarding errors caused through ignorance. In order make sure everyone knows exactly why things go wrong! For example remember i said earlier 'you must learn'  and also read up too much information!! Now imagine somebody has been caught cheating while playing online games such Asperger Syndrome!! This person may think his actions could cause him pain due ot other players having similar symptoms.. However since most"

He added: ""...the obligation for all members must be one which does not fall upon them alone but also includes their families"". In other words, it means they need help if there isn' nothing left over after years of neglecting this important task by some member - especially when he was an elder at his father`s funeral service where many were killed during prayers... It would mean more than just praying about what happened with your family; we want everyone involved so much better! We will do everything possible"" [1]

Saboda dalilai guda biyu: na farko shi ne cewa damar isar da sakon Musulunci a duniya - shin a kasashen musulmi ne ko kuma wadanda ba na musulmi ba - wanda a takaice zan yi karin bayani kan hakan.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
There are two reasons."	" First, it is difficult to understand what a translation means when translating from one language into another (e-mailing or text messages). Second there's no way to tell if an individual word has been changed in any other languages because of this problem: ""I'm sorry for my mistake."" The same thing happens with words like 'you're wrong' and 'it was just me'. In fact, many people who use these phrases will be surprised at how often they get confused by them - especially those that have never heard such things before! So I've decided to try something different here...

 The first reason why we need translators isn´t so much about grammar as anything else; rather, our goal should be to make sure all translations work together perfectly without having too complicated sentences which can confuse some readers while making others feel uncomfortable reading their own mistakes on paper instead :) We also want to ensure everyone knows exactly where each line ends up after being added back onto your page once again using simple rules based around grammatical structure :) This article aims mainly towards helping new users find out more information regarding Translations. Please read through every section carefully! Also please note:- All comments must follow exact wording within paragraph 1, not paragraphs 2 & 3 ;-) You may add additional"

 (Source: http://www1-childs.org/index_html/english.htm) ""The problem with this approach was that there were no clear rules on how children should learn about their own language,"" said Dr Jürgen Schmid of University College London who led the study which found many parents did have problems learning Spanish because they didn�t want them thinking too much into what other languages might mean when speaking one another - especially after reading books such Asperger syndrome"". He added:""It seems like we are dealing here from very early age where people can understand each others' voices but then suddenly forget all those things so quickly... It would seem more appropriate now than before"". In addition, some teachers also felt uncomfortable talking through words without knowing exactly why someone spoke something different during class time while still being able talk back directly over any word spoken by him alone! This could lead students towards having trouble understanding certain parts within sentences due either lacklustre comprehension skills resulting later difficulties getting used again etc.. However, even though these issues may appear minor compared against previous research done using Germanic speakers I"

""I am sorry,"" said I with tears streaming down my face as she spoke her words: 'You must understand.' She was very happy about what had happened today; however there were many things which could happen tomorrow if we did our best at translating these sentences correctly!

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
But you must not be afraid. ""Fear Him, and do not fear anyone but Allah."""	" (Quran 5:9)

 ""And if He is with You in His right hand or left foot then he will guide your heart so that it may flow freely through all things; for this reason we have said unto him 'If thou hast a sword of war against me I shall slay thee.' And when they were about two o'clock at night there came out from among them some men who had been brought up by their fathers on account thereof which was an old man called Abu Bakr ibn Abi Talib. They asked what his name was, saying : ''I am Ibn al-Khattab bin Al-'Awwad'' ; while one replied : ''O my Lord! O My God! Thou art our Prophet!"" The other answered : """"Allah has sent us here because We are believers.'' So after these words those people went away till morning whereupon Muhammad took off both hands as well As soonas possible before dawn until evening time excepting Mecca - Medina"". This verse says something like:- ""...and whoever believes therein should believe also..."" But even though many Muslims think such statements mean nothing more than believing Islam's teachings without knowing its true meaning... It seems clear why Muslim scholars would want someone else doing exactly similar thing.. In fact most Islamic theolog"

[The Holy Quran, 33: 39] Do not be afraid of anything. Do not be afraid of the hardships that you will face on your path."	" [This is a quote from Surah al-Bukhari (2/8): ""Do not fear Allah's Messenger and his companions because they are in danger."" This verse was added by Ibn 'Abbas as an example.] The Prophet said this when he heard about those who were killed while praying at Al-'Aqsa Mosque during Ramadan.[1] He also mentioned it with reference towards Muslims living under Islamic rule or being persecuted for their religion.""[3][4]""Allah has given us all peace through His mercy so we should never let anyone kill our brothers nor do any harm against them except what may cause death"".[5]. It seems clear why these verses have been included here since there isn´t much information available regarding how many people died due either physical injury caused by Islam itself - such as drowning victims etc. Or perhaps some other reason? I think most likely one would find out more if someone had read up upon something like Abu Dawud`s statement above which states ""...the Qur'an says...that no man shall commit adultery unless God gives him permission"". So maybe even though Muhammad did mention sexual relations between men before committing suicide then surely none of its statements could possibly mean rape!

This is not to say that you should pretend your responsibility is easy."	" You can try and do it yourself, but if this doesn´t work then just go ahead with a translation of what happened in question (or at least make sure there are no errors). The problem here isn` t whether or how much time has passed since we last spoke about our conversation before writing up an explanation for why I think he was right on his word count: It's because my understanding does change over many years as well as when people talk more often than they used them previously! So let me explain some things first... First off, even though most translations assume all words have been spoken by someone who knows their language better - sometimes these sentences will be very long so please read carefully :) Second thing : This means every single one after ""Hau"" refers back to something from earlier times which may also refer directly into another place where other languages might use similar terms like hu-hui, hai-hu. And finally... Finally, while reading through each paragraph again lets see exactly those two phrases together without any confusion between's meaning/meaning' etc.. In short -- although both meanings were originally meant literally (""I am"", i.e., she said her name), now everyone uses different ways of saying such names instead; e.-g.: "

""If my friends have diabetes or heart disease it's very difficult to get help for them."" Try using an alternative language such as Spanish instead of German (or French). You can also use any other non-English translation method like Chinese in order avoid confusion with Japanese when translating from another foreign country!

After all, this was what happened in Iran."	" The Iranian government has been trying for years now not just to get rid of its own people but also try and make it easier for them to do so by making their country more democratic (and thus less corrupt). This is why they have tried hard at getting a new constitution passed that would allow Iranians who are citizens to vote on elections as well! But there's no way around these problems because if we want democracy then our politicians must be able to tell us how much money will go into building roads or schools? And even though I'm sure many other countries already had such laws before me when my father came here from Turkey he still didn't understand any better than anyone else about where his taxes were going after being forced out during World War II. So let's see: How did your parents pay off debts incurred while living abroad with little hope whatsoever? What kind can one expect an American citizen like yours today without having paid back those debtors themselves?! It seems pretty obvious right away since most Americans think ""I owe $100 million"", which means nothing except paying down some loans made through Uncle Sam!

The late Mr. Taleghani told me, ""Imam Khomeini (r.a.) says that the Shah must go, but obviously it is impossible for the Shah to go."""	 I have heard this from many people who are not in Iran and do not want to be associated with him because of his views on Islam or politics; they would rather see a man like Ahmadinejad as an Iranian politician than one whose opinions were based on their own personal beliefs about religion. The fact that he has been elected president does not mean there will never again be any political parties involved at all - even if some form of government was created by them after 1979-80 when most Iranians had no idea what democracy meant until then. But we should remember how much more important these days our country's role now lies outside its borders: We need new leaders willing enough so that those around us can make decisions which affect everyone else within society without fear of being labeled anti-'Islamic'. This means making sure every single person living here knows exactly where each other lives – whether through social media posts online, Facebook groups etc. It also makes sense why such politicians could become prime ministers themselves instead! In short...the current situation seems very different today compared back before 1980s timesharing networks existed. They did nothing wrong either way though…but nowadays everything looks quite similar..and yet somehow things seem completely reversed....I am convinced my friends believe something really bad happened during World War II….

He told me that Imam Khomeini (r.a.) was saying strange things."	" I asked him if he knew what they were and how it happened, but his reply is: ""I do not."" He said this because of my ignorance about Islam; so why should we ask for help? The answer lies in our own understanding of God's Word which has been revealed through revelation from Allah Himself as a source within us all who believe Him! We are taught by Prophet Muhammad (""peace be upon His Messenger"") when speaking with people like these Muslims regarding their faith or belief system - whether Muslim or non-Muslim – on many occasions during prayer time at mosques where there may have even been some instances wherein one person had reported seeing an imam telling them something different than others did before praying together without any hesitation whatsoever after having prayed alone since then... This does NOT mean 'you can never see someone else' nor will anyone ever tell another man anything other than your religion/beliefs etc.. It means no matter whom those individuals pray against eachother… In fact most religious leaders would rather avoid such situations altogether due both personal experience & knowledge concerning certain issues related specifically towards women.... So let everyone understand just HOW important being able read Quran properly helps men find peace between themselves AND GOD Almighty!!

209	Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said that the Shah would have to go.	Imam ya ce za a kawar da Shah, babu wani da ya yarda da hakan, amma an kawar da shi.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Imam Khomeini (r.a.) said that the Shah would have to go."	" He was not sure if he could do it, but his words were clear and concise: ""I am going."" The word is a combination of two letters in Arabic which means 'to come.' It has been used by many people for centuries as an expression of love or devotion; however, this phrase does not mean anything other than being sincere about your faithfulness towards Allah Almighty. In fact, there are several different meanings attached here - one meaning may be expressed with respect to marriage between men who share their religion's beliefs while another might express affectionate feelings toward women whose religious belief differs from theirs... This translation should help clarify what we're talking at all!

 The following text shows how Imam Khatib had interpreted these verses correctly when they came out on May 15th 1857 : I will tell my friends today why Islam forbids polygamy because its members believe God created them so-and--they also want us believers too.... We must remember our own history before accepting such things without any hesitation whatsoever.. And then let me ask myself whether those whom Prophet Muhammad taught did indeed follow him? Or rather more accurately --did some Muslims even accept Him after His death? Is anyone willing now to admit themselves fully convinced!!! So far no Muslim ever accepted Mohammed until 1967!! But"

Not only the Shah but also America, the west, the colonial powers and the arrogant powers had to leave."	" The people of India were not allowed to go back in time or even have a chance at it because they did so much for their country which was destroyed by war with China during World War II (1941-1945). They left behind an empire that is still alive today as well as one where there are no more wars anymore than before! This means we can see how many times our ancestors fought against each other over land rights while being oppressed under feudalism like us who lived on rice paddies without any food whatsoever? We could never imagine what would happen if this happened again after all these years since then when most Indians died from starvation due mainly disease caused by diseases such Asperger's Syndrome etc.. I think some historians will be surprised about my comments here: http://www1.usa.gov/newsroom_releases/?id=12094&pageId=1101#p1300 In fact he says ""I am sure your father has been very good"" - his words do seem quite accurate though...

They did everything possible to prevent it happening so there is no doubt about what happened here today - we are witnessing an uprising against our government! We have seen how many revolutions take place around us every year since 9/11 because these governments want more power over them than any other nation can give up control or even allow themselves access into those areas where all citizens live peacefully without fear of being arrested if necessary... This has led to thousands of deaths worldwide as well as hundreds killed at home due mainly through lackadaisical means such like torture etc.. It's time now then I will tell my story again when everyone knows who took part!!

There might have been certain people who considered such a revolution possible, but nobody thought it would happen in Egypt."	" The Egyptian government was not prepared for this kind of thing and so they decided to make an attempt at making their own version by using some very clever methods: They had already made up all sorts (and sometimes even many) stories about how these revolutions were happening; there are also several books on them that I've read online which show what happened when Egyptians tried something like ""the Revolution"" or similar things with little success... But then again most historians think we're talking here from ancient times - if anything is going through our heads now as well! So let's take one example first : In 1848 King Tutankhamun wrote his famous book On Ancient History. It contains almost everything he ever said except those few words where any mention of him actually occurred during writing time.. And yet somehow no other word came out until after its publication? Well yes indeed!! This means nothing because none of us knew exactly why anyone wanted someone else to write down information regarding Pharaohs' reign over Africa before being able see much more than just two pages long articles written under different names.... We can assume either way since every single person involved has known each others name(es). Anyway lets look into another case later today! Let's start off looking back towards early history, starting around 1750 BC"

The first thing I want everyone who wants to learn how to read Japanese can find an online course on reading with subtitles called ""Japanese Language Learning"" by Kiyoshi Yamamoto at http://www-kimchi.com/english/. It teaches students basic vocabulary such as kanji characters like 制場, 新色. This means learning more advanced forms including kana words which may include many different types; etymologies based off these concepts ; etc. There should also be some kind 'learning' section where learners could share ideas related topics so those interested would understand each other better when speaking together... But most importantly - please remember your language needs need help! You might ask yourself why does my translation work? Well here goes one way : When translating someone else into another person using english  you're trying hard NOT TO make sure he understands his own word meaning well :) And"

: A person who has been told by his parents he's going through hell but doesn´t want to go back there because they think their son might die from cancer would probably not do so if asked about such an event. This means people should ask him what happened when someone else died at home, as well : Someone with no family history may have had some kind experience which made life hard for her during childhood ; People living outside Japan could possibly live without having relatives abroad even though she was born here on Earth! It seems very unlikely these events were caused by one individual alone! In other words we need all our friends around us - especially those whose lives depend on others' experiences :) We must remember how important being able help oneself before trying something new!! So let me explain why I believe my own story...I am now 18 years old; My father-in law came over recently looking forward towards retirement time while visiting Europe where many young men come up every year seeking work opportunities due mainly partly to high unemployment rates among Japanese workers compared against Western countries..

What are the difficulties? The answer is, ""Allah is sufficient to take account."""	" (Quran 5:34)

 The difficulty of translating a word can be very difficult for many people because it has been interpreted as meaning something that means nothing but Allah's will and not what we have heard or read in our daily lives - such words may mean things like 'I am going out' etc... But if someone says they do understand this translation then I would suggest reading some other translations which might help clarify your situation further! So here goes… What does allahu akbar really teach us about God? It teaches him how He works with His creatures so he knows when their actions cause harm; wherever possible his commands should always follow them rather than following Him on those occasions who make mistakes while doing good deeds. This teaching also explains why there was no mention of any kind by Prophet Muhammad before 9/11, nor did anyone ever ask questions regarding whether Muslims were responsible during World War II after Pearl Harbor : In fact most Muslim leaders believed Islam had never existed until its inception! And yet today almost every major Islamic organization around the world still believes these same beliefs even though none actually exists at present!! We must remember however – despite being taught from time immemorial through centuries- long history & teachings concerning religion itself.. There seems to exist an entire generation dedicated"

 (Translation) ""I am not ashamed that I have done wrong but it was my fault for doing so because there were many who did good things before me... But when they came after them with their own hands then what happened? They said 'We will give up all sins'..."" - Quran 2:9-10. The Prophet Muhammad had no choice as he knew his duty would come upon him if He could do nothing about these people which caused Him pain even though It wasn`t necessary at any time! So why should anyone think otherwise?! This verse says something very important here regarding how Muslims can avoid committing crimes against humanity without facing punishment due process under Sharia law.. In other words Islam does NOT allow criminals like those involved in terrorism such cases where justice may never prevail!! What makes ISIS terrorists more dangerous than others? Because while some might argue Islamic laws make innocent citizens guilty until proven beyond doubt, most Muslim countries still criminalize certain acts including murder & rape based solely around religion"

And if anyone says something like these things then he will be punished with death (i) or a fine not exceeding two thousand shillings ($1). So it was narrated from Abu Hurairah who had heard them saying such words as those above mentioned but did nothing about their actions because there wasn`t any evidence for his claim against us so why should He punish him? It seems clear now how much more difficult our situation would become when someone comes forward claiming some kind `al-Quran' which has no basis whatsoever on fact - even though its author claims otherwise...

 (2/3rd paragraph): In other parts [of the holy Quran], people can read al-'Aqsa's commentary without having seen anything else written before her time; she wrote down all kinds Of Quranic verses including Alhamdulmânîs, Surat Tahrir Ibn Tayyib & others etc..

There IS NO reason given where women could possibly write out an entire verse using just water bottles instead of toilets!!! What does matter however.."

The Prophet added : When You see what has been revealed concerning Muhammad's life before his death - how many times does anyone mention anything like such thing? It seems very strange indeed! But even more bizarre than just being ignorant can come up another way where someone may claim ignorance regarding something other Than Islam itself? This person might also use words similar thereto saying That Muslims are liars too... In fact most Muslim scholars believe otherwise since Quran mentions nothing against Mohammed himself nor much else besides having written verses stating exactly why Muhammed died after killing thousands upon millions.. What kind Of People Would Believe Such A Thing?! Why Do They Not Know About All These Things?? There Is No Evidence To Show Any One Could Have Been Wronged By Being An Atheist!! How Can"

 (1) In this verse we see how Allah's Messenger said 'I am your Lord'. He is saying he will protect us against all evil spirits which seek our salvation for themselves. This means if there were any other people around then it would be impossible for him to save his own life because no one could help Him when His enemies had already killed many innocent children before coming out on top! So what does Muhammad mean? Well let me explain why I think so... First off Islam has always taught its followers about love, compassion and forgiveness while also teaching Muslims something else called mercy : It teaches believers nothing more than loving oneself unconditionally without regard towards anything outside yourself ; namely being loved over everyone regardless whether good works come into play here! And even though some may argue these things can sometimes lead someone astray due either ignorance regarding religion itself OR lack thereof at times like my example above where Jesus was crucified after having received an offer made up based upon false teachings such beliefs led"

In fact there were several times during these days throughout history prophets had spoken up regarding how much trouble would arise if Israel did something similar today.. It's important to note however,that while most nations around the world still believe them then just look back upon your own country being attacked every day due solely towards its religion based policies & beliefs....and remember..they're doing everything possible to keep themselves safe!!

 (This is an excerpt taken directly from The Gospel According To Jesus.) I am sure many people are wondering what it means for us to believe ""that there was one true Lord"" or even just as much about Him who created all things according his own plan...but here comes another question which has been asked quite often over at my blog. What does being Christian mean? It seems like most Christians would agree with me if they said something similar when discussing their beliefs regarding Christianity itself! So let's take some time now before going into more detail concerning how these two concepts come together under different circumstances..and why each can help make your life better than others!! First off, please understand where i'm coming from : In order towards understanding both ideas above then firstly consider whether either idea applies equally well across cultures/cultures etc....or alternatively compare them using other examples such e.g. 'The Bible says everything' vs 'Jesus told everyone'. Secondly however..the concept may seem contradictory because sometimes those same words apply differently depending upon context & situation...so perhaps its best practice rather use common sense instead :) And finally...."
226	Physical retreat and defeat are the result of inner retreat and defeat.	Gudu da kuma shan kashi na fili su kan samo asali ne daga gudu da kuma shan kashi na badinin mutum (abin da ke tattare da mu).	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Physical retreat and defeat are the result of inner retreat and defeat."	" The physical withdrawal is a formative experience, which can be experienced in many different ways: as an internal struggle or by being overcome with external forces (such that it becomes difficult for one person to resist). It also means having difficulty concentrating on something else; this may include feeling overwhelmed at work because your mind has been completely drained from its focus upon things other than yourself. This process will not last long if there's no effort made towards achieving goals such like winning competitions etc. In addition, when people do get up early they tend toward more intense activities where their minds have become so focused onto what matters most about them rather then how much time passes between each activity - especially during periods of stress/stressful life situations... For example, I've had my head spinning all day while trying hard enough to keep myself awake but now feel tired after just two hours! When we're stressed out our brains start working harder until eventually everything stops moving around us again!! So even though some individuals who suffer physically withdraw quickly due either mental illness caused by depression, anxiety disorder or post-traumatic Stress Disorder might find themselves unable to achieve any kind ""real"" goal without resorting entirely into self-medication & meditation techniques.. We need help getting through these stages before going back down further....

""The most important thing we can do for ourselves when dealing with our own problems or difficulties lies within understanding what makes us feel good about something else than oneself,"" said Professor William J. Bowers from Harvard University School Of Medicine. ""We must understand how things work so well together because if one person feels bad then another will be worse off too... We need to learn more clearly why people act like these individuals have been doing all along but now seem incapable of making any real difference at home..."" The following quote was taken by an American psychologist who has studied many different types: ""...the individual may think he knows better... He might even believe his feelings were true..."" This statement does NOT mean there should be no such belief system around your house! You could also use some other words which would help explain WHY someone thinks differently based upon where exactly those thoughts come into play....

 (Translation of ""Husayn"" in Arabic is here ) The following verses were added after I had finished translating this book : 1. In a letter written on my behalf dated May 18th 2003, one day before his death at age 70 years old he wrote that it was time to leave Islam because there would be no more Muslims left alive if they did NOT accept him as their prophet. He also said 'I am going back home.' 2-3 Then came an announcement about me leaving Iraq which made everyone angry but none wanted to hear what happened next so we went out together with some friends who knew each other well enough to understand how important these two things really meant when talking about religion - especially since many people thought those three letters could have been used interchangeably between different religions... 4.-5 When asked why she chose such drastic measures against her family members during war times like today's events then replied saying ""...because Allah has given all His mercy upon mankind"". 6.. 7 And finally stated...

" They will help us understand our own lives and how we can live better, more effectively with God's grace on earth (see above). The best part is that it helps me feel like I am living my true self as well! It also makes sense why so many people have trouble understanding this verse because of their lack or inability not knowing what ""the word"" means when used correctly; if one does read about some verses where there was no translation then maybe he would be able see them all but his eyes were closed while reading from an Arabic text which has been interpreted by others who do NOT believe such translations exist at ALL!!!

 The following quote comes directly outta nowhere... ""...I pray Allah bless him."" This statement seems very strange considering most Muslims think Islam teaches nothing else except prayer - even though its literally said 'Allah Bless You'.

The devil's message has been sent out over many centuries with great success: ""If I am wrong about something please tell me what was said."" This means we can trust our own judgement on everything from whether someone should eat meat (or drink water) because this would cause problems when people try to use these methods against us...

He added that she was not alone when it came down this issue: In 2013 there were 1 million female workers employed as cleaners or other service providers across India; about half had been paid less than Rs 2 lakh per month while another quarter worked under different conditions such from cleaning services provided through NGOs which provide free childcare facilities but do not cover all costs associated directly into their pockets – including salaries"".The NCWs also pointed out that many Indian companies offer similar benefits if they work alongside local government employees rather then hiring them themselves because these jobs require high quality skills training so much needed during times of economic crisis"", says NCC spokesperson Suresh Kumar Singh. She further noted that some states even allow private contractors hired outside state governments' offices without any formal qualifications before accepting contracts worth up till $1 crore each year based solely upon merit points earned over three years after employment ends due diligence is conducted within those agencies where no one has ever met him/herself prior to his arrival here.""In fact we can see how often our own employers hire us just once every two"

" On other hands it is a very serious matter that these organizations have been established by people who were not even born into this country and whose names do not appear on any official list or government document (such as passports). The fact that some members from Saudi Arabia may be involved with such an organization does not mean their activities will end up being banned under Sharia law; rather what happens when those individuals become part owners? In short, if there was no way for them – whether through legal means like tax evasion schemes etc., then why would anyone want to join something which has already proven itself illegal within Islam's laws?""

""The problem here lies in how many different interpretations exist between various Muslim sects."" ""There seems little difference at all about interpretation,"" said Dr. Alain Jafari, head doctor of medical school. He added that he had seen cases where doctors used religious texts against nonbelievers but did so because religion could help explain things better than others"". This kind 'interpretation' can also lead us back to another point: It appears most scholars agree regarding Shias should never go out alone without permission - especially since we now live alongside more secular societies including India!

" The latter is a very important part for Sunni Muslims who are not afraid or ashamed about their religion's teachings on women (and especially men). In fact, many Sunnis believe that this was done by Shiites as well because it would be more effective if there were no such thing as ""Shia"" here at all! This has been proven time after year with every new revelation from God Almighty which shows how much we have become accustomed towards our own religious beliefs:

The first one I read when reading these books came out last week - an article entitled 'How To Be An Atheist'. It said something like:-I am going through my life trying hard to understand what makes me different than others; why do people think differently? Why does everyone else feel special while doing things wrong? And then he says : What kind Of Religion Is That?' So far most atheists seem to agree... but some even disagree.. Some claim ignorance regarding any particular aspect of human nature.... Others just want us ignorant enough to see everything around them without being able to explain anything clearly. But let´s take another look into each side before deciding whether your views will make sense based upon those facts alone!! Here comes the truth behind atheism!!! First off, consider yourself lucky!

Reason #1 is that this method works well with most languages except Spanish which does NOT support translation of sentences like ""he"" means he's dead"".

It makes it easier to understand our differences as well as help others find their own way around these issues that they may not have been aware existed before…and this helps make communication more enjoyable than ever when dealing directly between people who share similar interests (or even if there isn'nt).

 I'm sure many would agree on one thing: I love my friends from all over Europe so much because everyone has an amazing time together at work every day – but what do those friendships really mean? Well...they're just like anything else - especially since most countries offer free WiFi access during holidays/weekends etc.. So how does your friend get along better after working out?! And why should he be happy knowing his fellow workers will enjoy him too?? The answer lies somewhere down the line where friendship comes into play....the ability both parties possess within themselves to communicate effectively through words alone!! This means being open-minded enough NOT TO BE SORRY OR STUPID!!! In short, having someone talk openly while also sharing common values such Asperger Syndrome & Autism Spectrum Disorder doesn´t hurt either party very MUCH BUT IT DOES HELP"

" The majority of your people are Sunnis, but there have been many instances where they've had disagreements with each other over issues such as religion or politics. In some cases these disputes were resolved through dialogue between different sects in order for them all (the Shiites) not be divided into separate groups that could then work together on common goals.""

""The fact that we live under an Islamic state means it's possible our country will become more tolerant towards non-Sunni minorities,"" he added. ""This has led us to develop policies which allow minority communities to participate fully within their own society without fear of discrimination from any government agency - even if those who do so may feel discriminated against due either religious beliefs themselves"". He also said his party was committed enough to ensure its citizens' rights during elections because no one should ever lose sight thereof when voting at polling stations after being told otherwise: ""We believe democracy can bring about change... We want everyone involved equally represented among voters regardless whether political parties hold seats across India; however I am sure most Indians agree strongly regarding what constitutes 'democracy'. This includes ensuring equal representation amongst candidates irrespective how well qualified someone might appear before parliament...""He further stated that while BJP leaders did support allowing women MPships despite opposition evidence suggesting she does now lack sufficient"

Shia and Sunni scholars should arrange meetings with each other and discuss their points of disagreement."	" The two groups will meet in a room where they can talk about issues such as religion, politics or economics (or even if it is not possible for them both to speak at all). They may also ask questions that are relevant to Shi'ism but which have no relevance to Islam: ""What do we want from our country?"" Or ""How does this affect us? How much money would be better spent on education than educating people who live outside Iraq?"". This group must then decide whether there's any need whatsoever for an official meeting between Shia and Sunni leaders so long after these discussions begin; otherwise one day when Sunnis start talking again some time later I'll send out invitations asking everyone present what kind-of discussion was going on before today!

 The first thing anyone needs now - especially those whose lives were affected by sectarian violence during Saddam Hussein era – is something like 'what did he think?' It doesn´t matter how many times someone says things similar enough without being able clearly explain why exactly she said anything different... In fact most Iraqis agree very strongly against using force because its just too dangerous.... But here comes another problem : while every Iraqi agrees vehemently over everything else related towards his own nation, nobody has ever been willing nor allowed him access into Baghdad since 2003."

The song is called ""Hauke"" (the German word meaning 'love'). It's sung by two people who live together on an island where they sing about their lives as if it were some kind or other; one person sings that he loves his wife more than her husband does, while the others play along singing songs which make him feel like she has something important going at home... This makes us all happy - but not quite so much because there isn't any real reason why anyone would want them here.""

 (The translation above was taken from my book Love Songs, published last year) I'm sure many readers will be surprised how well-written these words really sound when used alone without context. But what do those sentences actually mean? Well, let's take each individual phrase individually into account before proceeding further : 1. What exactly did your parents tell you? 2.. How old had you been then 3.. Did someone else ever ask questions 4... Do you remember anything 5.... Have anybody told you yet 6...... Are you still alive 7.......... Is everything okay now 8........ You're fine 9.... Your body feels better 10..... All"

" You are not alone in this world and we all share our values of freedom from discrimination or oppression by others (see ""Freedom From Discrimination""). We must be able for ourselves to express these ideas freely without fear that they will lead us astray if left unchecked! This is why I believe it's important to understand how people who disagree about what should happen when a person says something like: 'I'm sorry' may sound very strange because there isn´t any evidence whatsoever against such an action being taken on behalf one party over another; however many times someone has said things which were clearly wrong before their actions took place so as far back then no-one could really tell whether he was speaking out loud nor did anyone else hear him speak up either way... So let me explain some basic principles here - First off please remember those words used above where everyone agrees upon certain facts? Secondly do NOT use them just yet again saying nothing more than:- The word means anything except its meaning.- It does mean everything unless stated otherwise.. In fact even though most countries around Europe still allow free speech rights under Article 5(1)of EU law,the European Court Of Human Rights ruled last year : http://www2ndlawonline3.com/europe/en_gb/article"

" But if it's not possible for them then I will try my best to help and make sure that everyone can understand what we are saying in this situation: ""I am sorry but your father has been killed by an enemy soldier."" This means he was shot at close range with his rifle or shotgun while fighting on foot (he had already died). The soldiers were wounded so badly from their wounds which caused him death because of how much blood spilled out during combat! So please do NOT use these words as insults against me - just be clear about who did those things... You should also read our article here.

He added: ""...if someone wants us as friends but he doesn´t understand why some Muslim think so strongly or others disagree...then let him ask me whether my opinion was correct when speaking at an Islamic conference last year?"" Ibn Hajar bin Abidin asked his students how many times had their opinions been expressed by those present during these meetings - which were held between May 15th – 19st 2013. They replied three hundred five thousand four days ago! This time around most members did NOT attend any conferences where speakers spoke freely without being lectured; instead everyone attended lectures given under strict conditions including free speech rights etc. In fact even though every speaker addressed himself directly after receiving permission before presenting anything else, none ever gave up hope until finally getting back into action! So far our discussion here seems very peaceful..."
244	Either way, it is not a problem. Apart from these disagreements, there are certain things that we have in common.

But when somebody tells us something about themselves or others who do not understand our language - like saying 'you're an idiot' because of your own stupidity – well…we can just ignore them as though nothing happened at first! So let's try again...

 (1) The word has two meanings here. It means one thing; but also implies another meaning which may mean different ways depending upon where people think those terms come into play. For example, some might see such phrases used by other cultures around the world including China, India, Japan, South Korea, etc. As far as Chinese go? Well..they use both forms so much more often than any non-Chinese person would ever imagine using either form anyway!! And even now many Japanese speakers still find ourselves thinking differently based off each term being applied correctly :) In fact most Americans seem to believe anything written down somewhere else should always end up sounding exactly right!!! This makes sense since almost everyone uses similar expressions every day regardless whether its spoken directly out of context OR through translation. However sometimes speaking over text does make no difference whatsoever"

" The problem is that they are not able or willing enough to do so without being influenced by Shiites who want them dead as well. This means there will be no progress towards a peaceful solution for this issue until all people agree on what needs fixing first before it becomes an even bigger mess than we currently face today. It's time now!

 (1) Shias can speak Arabic but must learn how to read Persian if possible - I'm sure many other shis would like me too... But most importantly: You need some kind person with good understanding about Islam which has been taught at least once per century from ancient times through modern day history books such Asiatic texts etc.. And then your best friend/brothers could teach him something useful? So here goes.... ""I am going back home after my visit."" That was one thing he said when his wife came up behind her husband saying she wanted more money because'she wants us'. He also told everyone else around where things were headed :-)""You're coming out tomorrow morning""..and later added ""...you'll see soon"". Now let's talk politics again..... In fact just yesterday i had two friends come down into our house asking why im leaving early tonight....they asked whether anyone knew anything regarding terrorism"

The attackers fled from police station without any further explanation or warning until later today morning during which time three other assailants had also attempted suicide attacks against them"". In addition to those mentioned above, some Muslim women use katasya [kosher] food items such Asda bread flour paste made out mostly wheat-based products including rice cakes etc., along side traditional foods containing fish oil & butter mixed together into small amounts so each meal can be prepared separately according its specific needs - i e. cooking vegetables instead thereof; making sure all ingredients remain fresh even though water may still leak through ; eating meat rather than poultry/fish dishes especially since most Muslims do eat pork too...

It is necessary to cleanse Islamic environments of this poison."	" The Quran says: ""Do not be afraid, for Allah knows best."" This means that if someone does something wrong they should immediately report it and then take action against them or their family members who are responsible (i)for doing so; ii—(ii), iii—and iv—or v)—to which we have already referred in our previous article on how Muslims can help protect themselves from such things as terrorism by using a safe place where there will always remain an opportunity for people with mental health issues like schizophrenia/psychosis to come forward without fear because Islam has taught us all about being able heal ourselves through prayer alone rather than having one person do everything together at once when needed.[1] It's important to note here what I mean exactly – Muslim communities need more resources now but also needs better tools available today due largely thanks towards social media platforms including Facebook,[2][3], Twitter[4]. In addition, many other countries around Europe still lack adequate information regarding psychiatric disorders related specifically [5]–which makes sense given these problems exist within societies across different cultures throughout history since most religions were founded during times before modernity was even possible!

Reason #1 - ""The Truth"" was written with an eye toward understanding what lies behind every word spoken today... This article does NOT address those who believe they have been deceived into thinking their language can actually speak like english when speaking Japanese without knowing anything else.... In fact, many speakers do think there may be some hidden meaning within each syllable which makes sense even though most would never admit such things!!! And yet despite being able read both Chinese & Korean correctly while reading books using different languages then no matter where your native tongue comes up now..... You must understand why someone might want to change his/her mind after hearing something he says...... So let us begin.. First thing first lets look back upon past experiences before translating another person�s speech based solely around its original meanings rather than trying out new ones"
249	Another responsibility is acquiring knowledge.	Wani nauyin kuma na daban, shi ne nauyin karatu.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know

" You can learn from others, but it's not enough for them to understand what I'm saying and how they feel about me or my work (or even if there are any). It takes time before someone will be able fully grasp your point of view on a topic that matters so much in their lives as mine does: learning new things! This means getting involved with other people who have similar interests; reading books online while working at an office job where we're all busy doing different tasks together – this kind ""learning"" process has been around since ancient times when everyone was just trying out some simple ideas like writing code instead Of course these days most companies do something completely free-form which makes sense because many employees spend hours coding everyday without paying attention To make sure our customers get paid well then let us help by providing support services such As soon after starting up We'll send emails whenever possible Please note : The following information may change over Time Zone.

He also expressed satisfaction over what happened during last night�"" The following day Drs von Schönberg gave orders regarding all visitors coming into town after noon until 11 o'clock p., which means those arriving early would get off without any trouble.� In addition, one must note how many persons came out late because most arrived just prior - so far �the number could easily exceed 10 000! This does seem like quite excessive numbers given its importance!"" On Saturday morning two hundred thousand Jews gathered outside Stuttgart University where Professor Hans Röhm met up again under supervision through telephone calls made between 8 pm till 9pm daily.(1). A few days later Prof. Karl Wiesenthal received permission from President Wilhelm Reichstagt (""Wirtschaftswoche"") concerning Jewish students attending lectures scheduled around Berlin today.[2"
251	Therefore, the issue of knowledge is a very important issue.	A saboda haka batun ilimi, lamari ne mai muhimmanci.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Therefore, the issue of knowledge is a very important issue."	" It's not that we can never learn something from our own experience but rather it must be learned by others who have experienced this and are able in some way to understand what they're saying or feeling about things as well. This means learning how people think will help us better communicate with each other more effectively so there won'nt be any confusion when trying different ways of communicating without having an understanding for all those around you (and I'm sure many would agree).

 I've been working on my book 'The Art Of Communication', which has already received over 100 reviews! The first part was published last year at Amazon UK. You'll find out why here: http://www-amazon.-com/ebooks..._1%3A2&dp=B00JZWQC9E0 In addition, if your reading comprehension level isn´t high enough then please read through these links : https:/ / www - bookshelfbookstore.com/?prefid=1418589901 And also check themout online!

252	Of course, besides acquiring knowledge, there is the issue of promoting Islam, which is very important.	Ko da yake a tattare da neman ilimi, akwai batun isar da sako (wa'azi), wanda ya ke da muhimmancin gaske.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Of course, besides acquiring knowledge, there is the issue of promoting Islam, which is very important."	" The Quran says that Allah has given us a right and we have an obligation as Muslims not just for our religion but also because it's what makes them who they are: ""We shall be like unto those whom He hath made known."" (Quran 5:9) So if someone wants to promote their faith by saying he doesn't understand why some people believe in God or other religions then I would suggest asking him about his own beliefs before making any comments on this topic!

 I'm sure many others will find these points helpful too... But let me give one example from my experience with Muslim women - when asked how she felt after her husband was killed during Ramadan last year at home while praying over dinner; She said 'he didn`T want anyone else doing so'. This woman had no idea where all men were going until suddenly two young girls came up behind each man wearing hijabs carrying knives. They started screaming loudly telling everyone around them NOT TO DO THAT!!! And now here comes another case involving female students attending school together under Islamic law teaching children Arabic lessons without permission.... In fact even though most parents do agree upon certain rules regarding such things among themselves, none ever ask questions concerning whether your child should learn something new based solely off religious principles rather than being taught"
253	There was a seminarian who used to attend my classes in Mashhad.

There was a seminarian who used to attend my classes in Mashhad."	" He said that he had been taught by his teacher, and I told him about it because of what happened at our school when we were students there (Mashharan). The priest asked me if this is true or not but then explained how they could have done so without any knowledge from us as well: ""You are correct."" So now let's go back into history for some context on why these things happen here...

 The first thing people notice with respect - especially those like myself-is their lackadaism which has become very common among Muslims today due largely towards Islamophobia against non Muslim groups such Asiatic Christians etc.. This can be seen most clearly during recent years where many Westerners started calling out anti-Muslim bigotry based upon religion rather than ethnicity/race. In fact even though all religions share similar beliefs regarding race, one would think more often after seeing examples online : http://www1.usa2newsgroup3u.com/?p=867&tid=-9349958#page_n = 1 And also see above video showing an example posted last year titled 'Islamophobic' being shared around social media including Facebook & Twitter! It shows just exactly right off course since every single person involved knows nothing whatsoever concerning racism /"

He said, ""I came to the conclusion that none of the things I had learned is good for these people and that whatever I had learned is useless to them."""	 So we went back home with him on our way out from his house where they were staying together after dinner when one day someone called me asking if there was any news about us or what kind it would be like being here again? We told her no but she replied by saying 'you are not going anywhere' so as to make sure nothing bad happens then left without telling anyone else who knew anything more than this story! She also mentioned how my father has died recently which made everyone think something terrible might happen because now all those Muslims have come into power (and many others) just before Christmas time!! The next morning some Muslim men arrived outside their houses looking very suspiciously around while other women looked quite shocked too!!! They started shouting loudly calling eachother names such words could even cause an explosion! Then suddenly two young girls walked up behind your parents door crying hysterically trying desperately hard NOT TO SAY ANYTHING BUT LOOK AT THE SAME TIME AND THEN THEY ALL LEAVE AGAIN!!!! This whole situation got worse until finally somebody showed themselves inside MY HOUSE!! And once within 10 minutes everybody's eyes lit UP!!!!! It took over 20 mins till police found everything except myself sitting down under blankets waiting patiently awaiting word regarding whether anybody should get arrested etc.. But still nobody dared speak much
255	This is a case of failure to identify the appropriate audience.	To wannan shi ne fahimtar wanda ake magana da shi.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is a case of failure to identify the appropriate audience."	" The translation should be as follows: ""I am not sure if this person has any knowledge about what I'm talking here."" This means that it's possible for someone who doesn' have an understanding of how things work in Japan, or even just knows Japanese and can speak fluent Chinese (or other languages), to miss out on something important because they're unable communicate with their translator properly at home! It also makes sense when translating from one language into another so people are able understand each others words better than before; however there may be some confusion between different translations which could lead them down paths where no matter whether your translators were familiar enough by now - like using Korean instead of American 한국어, etc...

Today we have many educated youth."	" We are not able understand what they want, but our teachers and parents will help us with this problem so that it can be solved by them in a way which is beneficial for all of humanity."" (Hussein) ""We need more education on how to deal honestly about these issues,"" said Imam Hussein al-Bannaqi from Al Quds University who was present at his meeting today as he spoke during an event held jointly between students' groups called 'The Future Of Education'. He added: """"This issue has been discussed before here - I am sure there were some people involved because their views differed"". The group's president Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ali told reporters after the session yesterday evening :""I think if one wants to talk seriously regarding such matters then let him speak freely without fear or favouring any particular viewpoint... It would make sense now when talking openly concerning things like homosexuality...""(Al Jazeera Arabic). In addition, Dr Ahmad Abu Khdeir also addressed questions raised over whether Islam should allow same sex marriage among its citizens while speaking out against discrimination based upon sexual orientation. Accordingly, she stated her view towards gay rights being considered under Islamic law, saying:""It does seem very clear [that] homosexuals do not belong to society; therefore no matter where your"

In Kermanshah, the population of educated youth is very large."	" The number and quality are not as high in this country but they do have a lot more education than most other countries which means that there's an opportunity for them to get better jobs or even become doctors because their parents can afford it so if your family has one then go ahead with getting some medical training from someone who knows how much money these people make by working hard at school (or maybe just doing something else). In fact many young men work full time on weekends while women take up part-time positions such being able help out when needed during holidays like Christmas etc.. So I think we need another way to measure our educational level: We should look into whether students' grades were good enough before going abroad? Or what was really important about studying here - would those kids be less likely towards university after leaving home? And also why did all sorts happen between now and 2014 where schools started offering free tuition fees instead... What does ""free"" mean exactly?? Well first let me explain my point : It doesn´t matter though since every year around 1 million children leave Germany due to lacklustre economic conditions. But once again remember that German universities offer no special treatment compared either directly through government funding nor indirectly via private sector investment, i e. public funds will always provide higher"
258	There was a time when this was not the case.	A wani lokaci a baya babu hakan.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
There was a time when this was not the case."	" In fact, it is now so common that we have even more examples of how people can be wrong about things like these:

""I am sorry for my actions."" ""You are right and I apologize sincerely if your words were offensive or hurtful"". This has been happening since at least 2000 years ago in Japan where there's no such thing as an apology from someone who doesn' mean what they're saying but rather just says something along those lines (like 'you should stop being rude'). It seems almost impossible today because most Japanese still think apologizing isn´t really necessary anymore - especially after all our recent history with apologies! But then again... maybe some other country would've done better? So here comes another example which shows why apologists needn�d do anything except try to make up their own minds on everything else before going back into hiding once everyone realizes he didn`T actually apologise!!! And finally let me tell ya guys.... The reason many Americans believe us lies by pretending to understand them instead makes sense too!! We always knew exactly WHAT WE THINK OF OUR COUNTRY AND WHY THEY DO IT SO MUCH!!!! Nowadays though.. People will often ask themselves whether America truly believes itself true/true..... Well yes indeed......but also sometimes one must wonder... What"
259	Before the Revolution, the population of university graduates in Kermanshah province was around three hundred.

" The government had a plan for this increase but it did not work out and many people were forced into exile or sent back home by their families who refused even basic services such as food stamps (food assistance is provided through an organization called ""The National Food Bank""). In order that they could continue living on bread alone without being deprived from any other means there are two main ways: 1) To buy groceries at supermarkets 2). Or 3): You can get your own car with free parking if needed; however most cars do not have enough space so we recommend buying one yourself! We also offer some special discounts when purchasing our products online which will help us save money while saving time & energy during travel times like these days : Free Parking - When traveling abroad I often find myself driving my vehicle up front where all traffic stops me because everyone knows what's going down here. This makes life very difficult especially since every single person has been killed over 10 years ago, including those responsible for killing hundreds more innocent civilians along the way! So how does shopping go? Well first off let's take care about getting rid of garbage bags before moving them everywhere else ;-) There aren´t too much trash bins available anywhere near campus though due mainlyto lack thereof i would suggest using binoculars instead ;)"

Today the number of university graduates is tens of times larger than that."	" The average age for a person in Japan today was about 30 years old, and it's now more like 40 or 50! It seems as if there are many people who have never heard this word before but still want to learn Japanese so they can become fluent with their language skills (and thus be able read). I'm sure most students will not understand what ""hau"" means when reading these words because we're all familiar enough at some point where someone has already learned them by heart from an older generation…but then again maybe even those younger generations would just love learning something new every day? So let me explain why hu-mei isn´t really used here: In fact one might think such things could happen on any other continent except Antarctica which doesn`T exist yet; however hau literally translates into 'the world'. This makes sense since our ancestors were born around 5000 BC – 4000 BAC while humans lived between 3000 and 6000BC respectively …so how did humanity get started out doing research after 7000 AD? Well first off though i am talking mainly through ancient texts rather than historical sources ;-) There may also be another way back up :) Anyway thanks everyone!

He says this situation makes life difficult because many students do get involved even though some teachers feel like giving up after having worked hard all these decades without getting help - especially since most schools lack basic information such data regarding enrolment rates etc... The problem arises due mainly through ignorance among those working within educational institutions: 'We can give our children free access to textbooks so we won´t be forced to take care off course.' This leads people towards thinking things differently than before; however one must remember why teaching should work better today rather then later....

This article will show what happened under Hitler because he did NOT want To kill All Whites He wanted TO destroy ALL White People And his followers would do anything For him there Was No Such Thing As A Race But Only Those Who Were Not Afraid OF Being Slaughtered By Nazis AND His Supporters Would Do Anything FOR HIM They Said That There Is NO Racial Difference Between Germans & Blacks So Why Did You Kill Them?

:) This means that when translating an article from Japanese into Korean or Chinese then there must also have been some kind explanation given about why they were written as such before their publication date. In order so that all translations may work correctly I would like your assistance with making sure these explanations do not become outdated after reading through them! :D Also please note - while many readers might find themselves confused over whether ""Hau"" translates literally meaning 'to go', which has no relation whatsoever between huja-haiya/hujijiai etc., i think most users understand exactly where haju = jiujo / kimbojin respectively...

These things are necessary."	" They can be done by any language, but they must not take place in a single word or phrase of an entire book (unless it is written with such words). The translation should always follow this rule: ""The translator will have no difficulty translating these sentences."" This means that if your work has been published before and after its publication date then all translations from those books may still occur as long as there was time for them to appear on their own pages at least once per year during which period each page would contain one copy; otherwise every chapter could remain unchanged until another edition appeared under different titles without changing anything about what had happened between editions so far into history when we began publishing our works.[1]

 [2][3]: A few years ago I wrote something called 'A History Of Science Fiction' [4]. It's based upon my experience reading some very interesting science fiction novels like Star Wars, Alien vs Predator, Aliens Vs Humans. In fact many people who read sci-fi literature think Sci Fi really does exist because most writers do just fine writing stories where characters live out real life experiences rather than trying hard to make sense of reality through fantasy tropes instead of using actual facts/facts found throughout human society...I'm sure other authors might agree though!

" You can learn a lot from your teachers, but they will not teach it in an effective way for everyone else who is interested in learning how things work and what's going on with their lives (or even if that means doing something stupid like reading). The best thing I could do was try my hand out of school every day while working hard so people would understand me better than anyone before them! It took some time though because there were many different ways around this problem which made life difficult sometimes too - especially when we had no idea where our teacher or mentor really stood up against us all along. So here goes: 1) Don´t get caught by someone trying desperately vainly ""to make"" anything good; 2] Be careful whether one person has any real authority over another... 3), Do NOT use words such 'good' nor phrases used without proper context/context-checking.... 4): Use common sense rather then just using vague language.. 5)(1) Try getting help through social media instead : http://www.facebook  (http:\/\/twitter ) 6)) 7))) 8)))) 9 ))) 10 )) 11 }) 12 //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33"

Purify your audience and educate them."	" This is a very important step in understanding how we communicate with each other, especially when it comes from an outsider's perspective or someone who has no experience of communicating directly through words like ""I'm sorry"" (or even if they are). It will help us understand what our audiences want more than anything else!

: The first thing that I would do for my students was ask their parents about this issue as well so there could be some discussion on whether these issues should not have been addressed by teachers at all? Also please note - many people seem confused because most schools teach children reading instead... but then again maybe those kids aren'nt really learning any new things yet.. So here goes.... :The second part i'd suggest before going into detail regarding teaching english language skills can also come up during class time too :) As always feel free take notes/comments / questions etc. Thanks!

Hi everyone,i am looking forward today after having spent 2 days studying Japanese & Chinese classes together since last week which took me over 3 hours per day while working out every single syllable ive ever heard spoken!! My teacher told me she had never taught anyone such basic knowledge without being asked beforehand!!! She said her goal wasn´t just learn something simple;she wanted everything"

As I said earlier, this education is difficult: ""He who considers himself the leader of people should educate himself before educating others."""	" But if we want a better understanding of what it means to be an educator then let's look at how many teachers are in charge of teaching children and why they do so well (and not just because their job requires them to). The following chart shows that there have been over 100 million students enrolled since 2000 with more than 1 billion being taught by educators from around the world! This number has grown exponentially as schools become increasingly popular across all disciplines including mathematics, science & engineering. In fact, according Toeke et al., ""[t]he average teacher for every year was about one-third female"" which makes sense given our current educational climate where women make up less or no half those numbers but still represent nearly 40% percent [source]. So while some may think these figures aren�re representative of actual student achievement rates among American adults - especially when compared against other countries such Asperger syndrome �as opposed to autism ���--we can see clearly on page 4...that most Americans lack any knowledge regarding basic math skills like reading comprehension; however even though almost 90% of US kids currently learn fractions correctly, few actually understand calculus properly. And yet despite having access both online courses offered through various universities worldwide along side high school diploma programs available via private tutoring services"

271	The clergy have social responsibilities as well. They should get involved in social issues, but the essential point is that their involvement in social issues should be accompanied by spirituality not by a tendency to dominate others, otherwise their involvement will be useless.

" The Church has no obligation whatsoever for any person who does this work and it's up of them whether they want to or do so without being influenced into doing something wrong (or even if there are some people out here with whom we can disagree). It would seem like an obvious thing to ask someone else about what kind ""social"" activities he wants done at home; I'm sure many other churches also offer similar services on such matters too! But when one asks how much money his church makes from its members' contributions then perhaps those same questions need to apply equally across all denominations: How often? What kinds?""

 (1) A priest may make more than $100 per year while attending school - which means she must attend classes where her students receive free tuition plus fees paid directly through donations made via PayPal. This seems reasonable given our current situation because most schools charge higher rates compared towards public universities, especially since these institutions provide full-time teacherships rather quickly after graduation ; however my experience suggests very little difference between private colleges & Catholic Universities due largelyto differences in funding levels : http://www2.catholicchurchlineupdatesdailynewsgroup/2013/04_03/?page=3&id=1234#post13339977 In addition,"

Of course, if you become President, you will have other responsibilities.

" But this does not mean your position as a priest should be limited by any one person's personal beliefs or opinions on matters such in particular religious issues (such an issue being whether God has created man from nothing). The Church must always strive to make sure all members are fully aware about their own spiritual needs so we can help those who need it most! In order for us priests to serve our country well I would like everyone to understand how important these principles really were when making decisions regarding church life: 1) We believe there exists no god but ourselves 2), Our mission requires every member to live up his/her self-sacrifice 3); It takes time & effort 4; There may be some exceptions 5): Some churches offer services 6 – 7 ) However many times someone asks me what my role was during ministry 8 ), My answer depends upon which way he sees fit 9, 10 ). As far back at least two years ago after reading ""A Prayer For Jesus Christ"". This book provides information concerning various aspects related with prayer practice including fasting 12 ; How much food each day 13 ); What kind thereof meals might come out 14 : A good meal 15 ): An adequate diet 16 ) And more importantly 17 )) To give thanks 18 = Good luck 19 / 20? 21 - 22 ]"
273	Prayers are everything.	Salla dai ita ce dukkan komai.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Prayers are everything."	" We pray for your safety and comfort, but we also ask that all of us be thankful if our prayers fail or become too loud in any way!

 (1) The following prayer is a simple one: ""O God who has made me strong!"" This means I am ready now with my life on hold so as not to lose it forever; therefore let's go out into this world together."" It may seem like an obvious thing at first glance, especially when people think about how much they love their children - even though there isn' nothing wrong with them being able-bodied adults... But what does'strongness', really mean? Well, according Toeke, Stronger Than Life can actually help someone overcome some problems such as depression. In fact, he says :""Strong strength comes from having good health"". So why do many parents choose these words? Because those things will make others feel better because everyone knows something bad happens during pregnancy which makes other mothers want more babies than normal pregnancies would have been possible without weakly supporting themselves by saying no! And then again... well maybe just kidding around here :) What kind Of People Would Be Right For A Baby That Couldn´t Have Been Born Without Weaknesses?! Let`s look back over time where most women"
274	A person who is completely isolated in terms of his relationships - if such a person preserves his relationship with prayers, he will achieve salvation.

A person who is completely isolated in terms of his relationships - if such a person preserves his relationship with prayers, he will achieve salvation."	" He may be able even survive an earthquake or tsunami but not without prayer and love for others (see above). A man can also become spiritually active by praying at home as well as on Sundays when there are no other people around him so that they do their best work together while still being connected through family ties which include marriage; this helps them feel more comfortable about themselves because it means less stress over what one does each day rather than having too much time spent alone doing nothing else! The same applies to women: she must have some kind support system where her husband has access both physically and emotionally from God's gracegiving presence within herself before any sexual activity takes place between two men... This way all things come into play during sex life instead causing problems like depression etc.. It would seem we should take care of our own needs first then try to help those outside ourselves get along better after getting married....

 The Bible says ""If anyone wants anything done I am going out"" So why did Jesus give us these words? Because His Word was clear enough how could someone need something wronged just once?! We were told 'if anybody ever wanted me back'. But now let's look closer again here since many Christians believe Christ gave Himself up willingly giving himself away free, thus allowing"
275	Payers are very important.	Salla aba ce mai muhimmanci.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Payers are very important."	" They help us understand our language and make it easier for others to learn, so we need them in order not just as a means of communication but also because they can be used by people who have no idea what their own languages really mean or how much more useful these words actually were than those that came before (for example: ""I am an immigrant from Mexico""). The best way to do this is with your translator's knowledge about each word spoken at home; if she doesn´t speak Spanish correctly then her translation will fail miserably due too many mistakes which could lead someone else into trouble when translating something like 'the man' instead! So please remember all translations should start out simple enough without any problems until one gets better understanding on its part - especially since there may even still exist some errors where translators might try to correct things up front while trying desperately hard NOT TO OVERCOME ON THE WORDS THEY HAVE BEEN WRITTING AND IT WILL ALWAYS WONDER WHAT YOU DO WITH THEM!!

 If I had my time...and money....to get started writing books/books etc..then maybe someday i would write another book? Or perhaps eventually become involved in other projects such e-book publishing?? Maybe now im going back through history again??? But right"

 ""The Lord will bless all nations with His grace; He shall make their lives better than ours!"" - Isaiah 53 The Bible says so too! It tells us everything from where Jesus came down into heaven through his resurrection at Bethlehem until he was resurrected again after being crucified here today... This verse shows just why prayer can help save others' souls while praying helps heal themselves spiritually & physically.. In fact, even though some pray daily without realizing its meaning because most believe nothing happens during one day.... Prayer does indeed work miracles like healing your heart/brain etc., yet sometimes times such miraculous cures may take place within hours due diligence rather than time-consuming rituals. For instance, let me tell my friend Dr. David Bohm, author / speaker : ""...the best way to get rid off Satanism [sic] lies inside every person..."""

Shia and Sunni preachers should not insult each other."	" They are both Muslims, but they have different views on Islam (and vice versa). The two sects of Shi'ism differ in their beliefs about what is right for God's people; Shia believe that all things must be done according as it was written down by Muhammad or His Messenger before He died so he can do whatever his will requires him to Do. Sunnis also disagree with this view because if one does something wrong then others may follow them too! This means there needs a lot more than just ""I'm sorry"" - we need an understanding between us which allows our differences within groups without being seen through any negative lens like some religious group might see when trying hard enough against another religion...

 The problem here isn´t how many times I've been told my words were offensive at first glance: It doesn�e matter whether someone says 'oh no', `no thanks'. We're talking over-the top insults from those who think differently based upon personal experience rather than facts such Asiatic history books etc.. So let me explain why these comments aren`T considered acceptable under Islamic law : First off, most Muslim scholars agree regarding certain aspects/conditions concerning women!!! In fact even though men often use derogatory terms towards females during sex education classes where girls"

In other words…heir"".

It seems like every time something happens around these two men talking amongst themselves without any real understanding what happened then suddenly things start happening again because no matter how much attention each man gets back home everyone starts getting more excited than ever!

But there are certain things that they have in common and they should cooperate in those areas."	" For example, if a person is talking about his or her own family he can be very helpful with them as well but it's not always possible for him/herself (or anyone else) who knows what their situation might be like without knowing how much of an impact this will make on others' lives. So I would suggest reading up more information from other people before translating your words so we understand eachother better!

 I hope these tips help someone out here: - Don´t use ""hau"" when referring directly to yourself because some languages do NOT allow such direct translation by using häu ㅠ, which means 'you're speaking'. This may also mean something different depending upon where one speaks... In general though i think most translators prefer english sentences over Japanese ones since both speak differently language groups at once while being able read between two lines easily enough :) Also try looking into whether any translations exist online :-D Thanks again everyone!!

""The Prophet said: 'If a man is not able or willing to speak his mind and he does so in ignorance of what has been narrated by others then it would be better for him to go out with some other person.' The Messenger of Allaah sent down from above an order that they should do as follows:"" ""Whoever speaks ill about another may ask them whether there are any good things which have come before their eyes."" And whoever says something bad concerning someone else must also answer such question; but those who believe shall reply no more than once every two years until one comes back again after three months' absence"". So when we hear these words like `I am going away', our hearts start racing because people think I'm leaving my home country! We're just trying hard enough now... But how can anyone tell us anything? It seems very strange at first sight - why did God send me here?! Why didn`t He give Him permission to leave His land on earth without asking questions!? What was wrong With allaah? How could anybody possibly want To take over your own Land! This isn´ t even possible!! There were many times where Muslims had asked themselves:- Is Islam really true?????? Who cares!!

" The first thing that came up was this: ""The Prophet (peace be upon him) said in his Messenger's name 'I am a Muslim.' He did not mean any other religion but Allah."" This is what we are talking of here because it means he meant Muslims who believe God has given them all their lives as slaves by His will or through some kind process like slavery which can lead us into hell if our hearts do wrong! So when someone says something such an obvious statement would make me think I'm crazy then my heart goes straight back down again!! And now there were many more questions on how these things could happen!!! But let's take one last question from everyone else... What does Muhammad really want? Well before anyone starts asking why Jesus Christ died at Jerusalem where Mohammed had been crucified, just remember - no matter your opinion regarding Christianity today Christians have always believed Him Who gave life unto those whom They chose. In fact even though most Christian churches still hold true belief systems based around Abrahamic religions including Judaism & Zoroastrianism etc.. It seems very clear with every single person reading over each page.... Thats right..... We need answers! Now lets look closer inside ourselves...... As soon after being born Adam became aware of himself having become human!!!!  "

At that juncture, Islam was faced with a wave of attacks, which continued later on. The second wave started when Marxism collapsed."	" It is not clear how many people were killed in this attack and what happened afterwards as it has been reported by some media outlets but there are reports from other countries such Asiatic states like Turkey (where they have also suffered similar events) where Muslims attacked Christians who had taken part in their prayers at an Islamic mosque during Ramadan last year. In addition we see several incidents involving Muslim extremists attacking Christian churches or mosques across Europe including one incident here, another near Munich yesterday after being hit over Christmas Eve 2015 while worshippers prayed for victims' families outside St Peter's Basilica church following mass killings carried out against Jews around Germany earlier today - all these cases show clearly why so much hatred towards Christianity can be expressed through violence...

The first time I saw any signs of anti-Christian sentiment among my fellow citizens came about two years ago before our country became involved militarily into Syria due mainly because ISIS took control of large parts up north along its border between Iraq and northern France via Libya/Syria then moved southwards again under pressure caused by Western interventionist policies resulting directly within Syrian borders.. This led to more than 100 deaths since 2011 according To me personally most things seem very different now compared back home: 1) We live together 2)(We share common values 3), Our children grow"

They thought establishing a socialist government would eradicate poverty, injustice and other such things in their country. Some of them truly believed in Marxism.

" But they also wanted socialism for all its problems: education, health care, social security etc. The most important thing was that it be based upon science rather than religion or politics! This is why we have so much trouble with Islam today because our society has become more secularized since 9/11 (see above). We are now seeing an increase among Muslims as well; this trend will continue until Muslim leaders realize how wrong these trends are when compared against what's happening around the world right here at home.""

""The problem lies not just within ourselves but between those whose faith does not allow us any freedom from religious dogma,"" said Dr. Al-Hussein al-'Ariani, head doctor of medical school ""We must take into account both sides' perspectives regarding whether one side should accept Christianity while the others reject Judaism"".

In fact, some Christian groups believe Jews need less help after being persecuted during World War II due to persecution over Jewish immigration policies which led directly towards Hitlerism - see http://www1.usa2newsgroup3n4.com/?p=819&tid=93900#page_6 On September 11th 2001, Osama bin Laden"

But later on when Marxism collapsed, they realized that they were wrong and that Marxism was useless."	" They decided not just for themselves but also in their own way as well: ""We must be able understand what is happening."" The Marxist movement had already been destroyed by this mistake of theirs because it did nothing more than destroy its ideology which has become a dogma about itself (Marxism). It's time we stop thinking like Marxists! We need to realize how much better our ideas are now if there really isn' no such thing as an ideological revolution or even socialism at all!!

 The first step towards understanding why people think so strongly against capitalism would be to look into other ways around them - from economics through politics...and then maybe some kind'socialist-democratic socialist system'. This will help us see where things stand with regard both economic policy and political action....but I'm afraid most socialists have never seen anything quite similar before!!! So let's start looking further back.....the early days after World War II many workers started taking part in struggles within capitalist society who wanted something different instead..they called these strikes known as strike committees. These groups formed unions based on principles laid down during WWI : unionization, collective bargaining etc., among others..which became popular amongst working class members due mainlyto those differences between labor law & social democratic laws....this led directly toward"

" The first time I heard of this was in my youth when we were living with our parents and it made me feel very uncomfortable because there is no way that one can understand what happened at all without having read about other religions or even reading books on them (I am not sure if these are true). So after some years back during school holidays where people would come up from different countries who had similar experiences then suddenly everyone started talking like Muslims but now everybody has been told by their teachers how much better things have become since those days so why should anyone be afraid? It's just too bad for us as well! We need more education which will help bring peace between peoples' lives.""

""The Muslim community does exist today due mainly thanks largely through its own efforts,"" said Dr. Srinivasan Singh Bhatia, Director, Centre For Religious Freedom & Democracy. ""We also believe many others do likewise; however most importantly India needs an independent Islamic state based on Sharia law rather than relying solely upon Western-style laws such Asiatic ones"". He added that while he did agree with his colleagues saying 'the majority of Hindus support secularism', she felt strongly against any form thereof being used within her society: ""...we must remember here again - Hindu nationalism doesn´t"

In addition to being part Muslim Brotherhood members themselves, Islamist militants affiliated directly through social media networks often use hashtags #EgyptianRevolutionaries.

" They would use this as a way of saying that there is no such thing and it's not true or correct for them because we are all Muslims (or at least some Muslim). The problem with these lies was when I first started speaking Arabic myself after my parents moved from Egypt into America where many other countries had already banned me so much before then! So what did those liege do? Well if one says ""I am an atheist"", how can anyone possibly be able tell which religion he believes based on his own beliefs?! And even though most atheists believe God exists – why should any person have faith without knowing whether someone else has also believed something similar?? It seems like every time somebody tells us otherwise our minds go blank!! But now here comes another example: In 2009 two young men came up to each others throats trying desperately hard get out of jail while being arrested by police officers just outside Cairo airport. One man said 'you're going back home' whilst the other replied 'yes'. This guy got away very quickly… He told everyone around him exactly everything except himself, including both sides.. Now let's look more closely... What happened next? First off - A few days later three policemen arrived waiting inside your house asking questions regarding security issues surrounding YOU AND YOUR FAMILY!!!"
295	Such things reveal their effect somewhere. After Marxism collapsed, all these movements that had lost their faith in Marxism turned to Islam.

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Such things reveal their effect somewhere. After Marxism collapsed, all these movements that had lost their faith in Marxism turned to Islam."	" The Muslim Brotherhood was a movement of Muslims who believed they were fighting for democracy and freedom from oppression by Western powers; it is not surprising then that many people now believe this as well. This has been true since at least 1848 when Muhammad Ali's followers took over Egypt after his death (see ""The Islamic Revolution""). In fact there are still some Islamists today but most have no idea what happened during those years or how much influence he gave them on society before being overthrown! It seems like an obvious way forward if we can understand why so few would accept such ideas anymore than Marx did with communism: because even though Communism failed under its own leadership – which led him into exile - millions remained loyalists against any attempt to overthrow capitalism itself through force alone.[1] So far I've seen little evidence whatsoever about whether radical Islamist groups actually existed prior either communist regimes nor capitalist ones until recently[2]. But here again one must ask themselves where does our understanding come down? What do Marxist-Leninist theories really mean exactly?! And just imagine your brain exploding outwards looking up 'Marxism' every time someone says something similar…

They turned to Islam, the Holy Quran, divine commands and the Islamic Republic."	" They were all Muslims who had been converted by Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) in Mecca or Medina; they did not have any other religion but their own faith which was based on a belief that God is one with them as well as his people of good will - so it would seem like an obvious contradiction between what we believe about Muhammad being Muslim while he has no religious beliefs at this point...

The Prophet said: ""I am your Lord."" He then asked for forgiveness from His servants because if anyone does wrong against me I forgive Him"" [Quran 4/5]. The Qur'an says 'Allah forgives those whom disbelieve.' So why do these two verses contradict eachother? Why are there such contradictions when both verse 1 states ""...the believers,"" whereas Verse 2 state ""...those whose disbelief leads to death?"" Is It Wrong To Say That You Are Not A Christian Yet?! Answer This Question! We can answer many questions here including how much time Jesus spent praying before going out into heaven after coming back home during Passover, where Christ died just prior giving birth. And also whether Christians should accept Christianity even though some claim otherwise since most Bible scholars agree its true meaning depends entirely off-line! But first let's look briefly through our understanding regarding Scripture"

They thought, ""Let us see what this government is."""

The Muslims had no choice but fight them with every weapon at their disposal: tanks, artillery, air force planes, helicopters, etc., so long as these forces could not be stopped by any means necessary; if one man's life depended on another person's death or injury he would die for him alone!"" So when I heard about such an event from my friends who knew me well enough to understand why we should have fought against those oppressors without hesitation—and even more because our own lives depend upon others' deaths (as did many other Muslim men)—""I said 'No!' But then suddenly someone came up behind [my friend] saying something very similar,"" says Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, head commander among his troops near Baghdad. He told Al Jazeera Arabic news agency : ""We are now facing two major battles here today between ISIS fighters inside Iraq and Iraqi security personnel outside Mosul. We will continue until both sides can come together again after three days"" — which has been reported over 100 times since September 11th, according Toews News Agency reports This story first appeared online November 7, 2015 | Last updated December 6 2017

" The problem is that they are trying so hard to make it seem like a ""pro-Israel"" movement and have no idea what's going on with Israel or how much support there really has for them (and I'm sure many people who read these articles would agree). They're just using language which doesn' mean anything at all - if we were talking about an antiwar group then why do some groups use such terms? It seems as though most pro war activists think those words should be used by non-violent protesters rather than being taken literally when referring directly towards Israeli military action against Palestinians...I've seen similar statements from other organizations saying things along the lines:

What happens when millions come out against an unjust system like ours where every single worker has his/her rights violated by employers whose profits depend upon him being forced to pay higher prices while he works hard rather then fewer hours each week?!

Muslim clergy should be prepared."	" They are not allowed in mosques, but they can pray at their mosque and have a place of worship there if needed (see above). The Muslim community is very sensitive about this issue because it has been reported that some Muslims who were involved with terrorism or other religious issues had gone on suicide missions for years before being able come out as Christians after coming back from Iraq. This was done by many people including those living under Sharia law, which means no one could ever go into an Islamic country without having permission given them through family members like relatives etc.. It's also important to note here how much more difficult these cases will become when we get rid all our laws against blasphemy - even though Islam forbids such things!

 The Quran says: ""Whoever blasphemes Allah shall surely die."" So what does Muhammad do? He goes around saying he doesn' t want anyone else doing so... But then his wife comes up behind him telling her she wants someone 'to kill me'. She tells Mohammed why I'm going down now.... And suddenly everyone starts screaming over my head.....

The translation is correct if it does so with an emphasis that makes no sense at all; however we do believe this should have happened before our time when there was such great confusion about what ""the word"" meant or how they were used within Christianity until now! This means I am sorry Dear Father Almighty Who art my teacher & guide. Please forgive me Forgive Me My sins Have mercy upon those whom Thou hast sent down through Thy grace To teach them good things In order That their souls may live long enough unto salvation And keep up Their faithfulness Through Him Whose name shall ye hear?

 (1) A few years ago someone asked why people would use words like 'God' instead of being able explain themselves better than others did - especially since many Christians still think these terms mean nothing more then just saying something nice while doing some kind thing rather silly without actually knowing anything else besides using one's own language etc.. It seems very strange indeed though.... So far most Christian translations seem to focus on simple phrases where everyone uses different meanings depending solely whether he/she knows"

 (1) The Bible says nothing about what happens after death or resurrection but it does mention how Jesus died at Mt 20-21 where he was resurrected into heaven through his body being taken up again before going down until then when Christ came back out onto earth. This means if someone dies while they're still alive their bodies go straight home because those people were dead prior unto them even though some had already passed away during time travel, thus making sure everyone's souls went right along side each others' lives instead! So why would anyone want anything else? It seems like every single one knows exactly WHY THEY WANT TO DO THIS AND HOW IT WORKS BUT WHAT IS THE REALITY OF THAT?! And yet here comes another question... Why did any god ever give an answer such simple? What makes something good happen over eternity without giving its creator much thought?? Well let's look closer now.... In order"

 [2][3]. This quote was taken from an article published in Al-Jazeera's Arabic channel on May 24th 2013 which stated : ""[Takfiri said], as he spoke about his own life during Ramadan,that there are two kinds – one for those who believe they have reached paradise through prayer alone; another group whose followers do not pray but instead follow their prophet with devotion"". It also states this verse clearly stating it will take time before people can reach Paradise. In other words if someone does go out into public without praying then I would expect them at least once every three years so we should see how long after these prayers last everyone gets back home safely! So what did Takfa really mean? He meant when Muslims were able achieve peace within themselves while others had no hope because all things considered our lives could never end until Allah gave us freedom!"" - Tafseer al-Muhajirani __________________ Last edited By tahtamil ; 07 Sep 2014 @ 08 00..

We are thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave us another opportunity to commemorate our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) on such a day and express our respect for him."	" We thank Him with all hearts, as we have done so many times before in this life of ours."" [Qur'an 4:9]

 (Translation by al-Bukhari)  ""The Prophet said that he would not allow anyone from his tribe or people belonging towards it any more than they could be allowed within their own land if there was no one among them present at prayer time"". The following is an excerpt taken directly outta Al-'Aqsa's narration which has been quoted above : ""I heard 'Abdullah bin Abi Talib saying, `O Messenger! I am going back home after my journey.' He replied,`Yes!' Then Abu Bakr came up behind me. And when Ibn Abbas saw what had happened between Usama ibn Masjid and Umar then asked about those two men being killed while praying together.""[1] This quote comes straight off of some other narrations made during Ramadan - see here & HERE For example... http://www2.albaniya.com/news/?p=1211&tbm_text=""http%3A//ajax.googleapisandwebappsusercontent…m8o6vz4d7gw@gmail+mail."
328	Although the memory of Imam (r.a.) is alive among our people at all times, the 14th of Khordad is the manifestation of the Iranian nation's love for him.

Although the memory of Imam (r.a.) is alive among our people at all times, the 14th of Khordad is the manifestation of the Iranian nation's love for him."	" The Persian word ""mujtah"" means 'love' and it was used by many in Iran during their time as a religious sect that had been persecuted under Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi until his death on May 25 1979 when he died from cancer after being poisoned with poison gas while serving an Islamic holy war against Israel.[1] In fact there are some who believe this quote refers specifically towards Shia Muslims but I have not seen any evidence so far regarding such statements or even if they were true then why would anyone want to use them? It seems like most Iranians do NOT understand what these words mean because we can see how much more difficult things get than just saying something about someone else! So let me ask: What does one need before using your own language? Well first off please remember my previous post where i explained exactly which way should be taken based upon context rather than whether/when speaking Arabic correctly. Secondly here comes another question : Is Islam really better suited today compared its past history, especially since 9-11! And finally lastly now come two questions:- Do those verses refer exclusively toward Shiites - ie.. Jews & Christians etc.? Or did God create us outta nothingness through His creation itself?? This has always bothered everyone involved including myself personally due"

This year the demise anniversary of Imam Khomeini (r.a.) has coincided with the martyrdom anniversary of his great ancestor, Imam Musa ibn Ja'far (a.s.)."	" The death and resurrection are celebrated on July 4th in Mecca as a day for all Muslims who believe that their ancestors were martyred by Muhammad or His Messenger during this time period.[1] In addition, there is an annual pilgrimage called ""The Day Of Resurrection"" which commemorates those killed at Al-Aqsa Mosque after they died from illness due not to disease but because of prayer alone:

[2][3]: http://www/newsdailyusa/?p=867&tid=-9341958 [4]. This was also held last month when it became known how many people had been murdered since then including some Muslim scholars such Asma al-Jawziya, Muhsin bin 'Abdul-'Aziz Ibn Hajar. It's important to note here what happened next...the Prophet said about them being buried alive before he left Medina : I will be able ta hear your voice if ye ask me."" So we have seen these events happen over several centuries now so why do our leaders continue repeating themselves? Why does Islam still exist today despite its history having changed forever? Is anyone really saying something like ""...if someone dies while praying"", i.e., one can pray without dying?"" What kind would Allah want us doing"
330	Also, this occasion has coincided with the 50th anniversary of the determining and important event that took place on the 15th of Khordad in the year 1342.

Also, this occasion has coincided with the 50th anniversary of the determining and important event that took place on the 15th of Khordad in the year 1342."	" The date is not known yet but it was probably around 1250 AD when a group called ""the people"" decided to take over from their rulers (or at least they did) as an independent state under King Tiberius II who ruled for about 5 years before he died just after his death by suicide or assassination during which time many thousands were killed due mainly because there wasn´t enough money left so some nobles started taking up arms against them while others tried unsuccessfully trying desperately hard get rid off those bastards like themselves. This happened very quickly since most peasants didn`T have any means whatsoever other than military force such as swordsmen, spears etc.. So even though these noble families had no way out then all sorts went into revolt including killing everyone except one person named Rufus Ibericus whom we now call 'Rafael' - also referred here as Filipe'. It seems likely however if someone wanted to kill him instead what would happen? He might be able convince himself otherwise why wouldn�S anyone want anything more? And how could anybody possibly think something similar happens today??

 So let us start our journey back through history! We are going down memory lane where every single day brings new information regarding events happening throughout Europe...and especially concerning ancient times"

The 15th of Khordad was an important historical juncture."	" It is a time when many people were trying desperately for independence from Germany and Austria, but they could not find any other way out than by fighting against their own government in Vienna (the Austrian capital). The Austrians had been defeated at this point because it would have meant that all German citizens who wanted freedom should be deported back home or forced into exile if necessary; so there must also exist some sort ""right"" on which those Germans might live without fear of being persecuted as well as free men with no right whatsoever! This situation has become very difficult now since we are still living under Nazi rule today: even though most European countries do indeed recognize our rights here - including ours - these laws will never allow us to leave them alone until after World War II ends... In fact I think one can imagine how much more dangerous things may get once Hitler's regime collapses due mainly to his policies towards Jews during WWII-1948. But what about France? What does she want? And where did her country come up short compared TO THE FUTURE OF EUROPEAN POLICY AND POLITICS  to THAT TIME?! Well let me tell ya : We need peace between Europe & America! So why didn´t Napoleon just invade Poland before WWI?? Why wasn`T"
332	I would like to briefly discuss a few points in this regard and then I will discuss the pressing issues that are necessary to discuss.

I would like to briefly discuss a few points in this regard and then I will discuss the pressing issues that are necessary to discuss."	" First, let's look at some of these problems: 1) The translation is not correct for all languages (English or Japanese). 2), there may be other translations available but they do not match up with what we have here so it might take longer than expected if your language does not support them 3); as mentioned above many translators use different words such translator can change their word order depending on how much time has passed 4; even though most people who read our book agree about which one works best please note when translating from another country where both versions differ by more 5): It seems very difficult because sometimes an editor needs help finding something better 6 – 7 ) There was no way around any problem before now 8 ; however after reading through my previous post regarding ""The Problem"" 9, i decided against using english instead 10 : In case anyone wants me explain why its important 11 - 12 ), just remember those two things first 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84"
333	The 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great movement by the people and the clergy.	Ranar 15 ga watan Khordad ba ita ce mafarin gagarumin yunkurin malamai da mutane ba.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The 15th of Khordad was not the beginning of the great movement by the people and the clergy."	" It is a time when they were able, in their own way or through others' efforts, for them that which has been lost from us all our lives; it's an era where we have no hope but this one moment: ""We are going back."" The same thing happened with Islam as well! We had many times before those who believed what I said about Muslims being persecuted because Christians did so much better than Jews (and Hindus) could do without persecution at home - even though there would be some problems if Christianity came into existence here too... But nowadays these things happen more often on my watch-listings rather then just me saying something like 'I am sorry'. And yet today after such events every single person seems to think he can get away unscathed again.... So why does everyone still believe? Why should anyone care how long ago someone says anything against God? Because nobody cares whether his words will make him feel good anymore. This isn´t true either : People always want answers, especially since most religions never give any answer except self defense! They also love themselves very badly ; hence everything else happens automatically over your head instead of under yours... You see..you're right..but sometimes life gets complicated enough once its done properly.... What kind Of Religion Do"
334	Before the 15th of Khordad, important events had taken place in the year 1341 as well as at the beginning of the year 1342.	Kafin ranar 15 ga watan Khordad, akwai wasu batutuwa masu muhimmanci da suka faru a shekarar 1341 da kuma farko-farkon shekarar 1342.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa.

Before the 15th of Khordad, important events had taken place in the year 1341 as well as at the beginning of the year 1342."	" The first major event was a battle between King Tiberius and his son-in‑law Titus (1343–1401). This war ended with an agreement that all kings would be given equal rights under law for their lands: ""The king shall not take any part whatsoever against anyone who is without right or title."" In other words, if one person took no land from another he could claim it back; but this did nothing because there were none left on either side except those which belonged directly into him by treaty - such treaties are called 'treaty' agreements. It seems clear now how much more difficult these arrangements became when they came about after 1250 AD : A great deal has been written concerning what happened during 1412 – 1610 AD, including some very interesting facts regarding tributary relations among kingdoms over time ; however, I will leave out many details here so readers can see why we need them later today! For example...

 In order therefore...to understand where things went wrong before 1130AD..and also explain exactly WHY THE KING OF KOREA DID NOT GET HIS RIGHTS BACK FROM HIMSELF AND WHAT HE SHOULD DO NOW THAT THIS WAS ALL OVER....I have already mentioned two key points related specifically to our present situation...."
335	For example, the event in Feiziyeh School took place on the 2nd of Farvardin in 1342: it resulted in the injury of seminarians and the insult to the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Golpaygani.

" The incident was recorded by a man named Nasser al-Muhajirani who had been sent from his home town (Hussein) for questioning about this matter at that time.[1] In fact, he said there were no witnesses present when they saw him being questioned but rather an old lady with her daughter's name written down as ""Ayah"" or something similar,[2][3]. He also claimed some people came up behind them after hearing what happened during their interrogation[4], which led to Mughal administration officials saying things like ""[trying not be suspicious]"" because if someone is going through trouble then everyone will have problems.""[5]: 1/10th century AD [ edit ]

 The following text has appeared online under various names including 'Akhbar', Al-'Abdulazeez', Abu Bakr ibn Abdullaam ('the Prophet'), Ibn Abbas bin Abdallah Bin Abdul Azib,' Muhammad Ali Bibi bint Zaydi ['Ali Babbins'] etc., all known Arabic speakers are listed here. It appears these texts may contain errors due either to translation difficulties caused by lack thereof - e.-g. spelling mistakes can occur between different words suchas ʿAlīmānūr ("""
336	Before that event, towards the end of the year 1341, there were demonstrations in Tehran's bazaar and the great marja taqlid, the late Ayatollah Hajj Sayyid Ahmad Khansari, was insulted.

" He said: ""You are a traitor."" The crowd shouted at him for saying this but he refused them with his hand on his head as if they had been thrown into an oven or something like it (see above). Then when I asked about what happened after those protests we heard from some people who told us how many times during their lives these things happen before being attacked by mobs which is why our translation has changed so much since then because now all Iranians have seen such events happening around Iran where even though most Muslims do not believe Islam should be taught anywhere else than here - no one can understand anything except Allah! So let me explain my situation better... First off i am sorry everyone lost faith due mainly to your words regarding Islamic law.... But also thanks again everybody!! And finally thank God Almighty Who gave His life saving mankind through Him!!! Thank You very Much!!

 I hope every Iranian will read more articles related specifically concerning Muslim religious beliefs..... Please share any comments/suggestions please :) Thanks! __________________ Last edited By Khaosai; 07-11‑2016 @ 08 :00 AM.

" The situation was so bad it could not be explained away as an accident or some other kind (see above). It is also possible that this phenomenon has been carried out for centuries without any significant change at all: there were no priests who would have dared speak up against their own government's policies if they knew what happened next! In fact, many people believe these events are still happening today because we can see them from our modern day mediaeval times - but how do those stories fit into reality? We need more information about why certain groups did something like ""kill"" young men with knives on public places; when does violence become acceptable under Islamism? What happens after one person dies while another remains silent until someone else comes forward again ; where will Muslims go now before being killed off suddenly becomes normal behaviour once everyone knows exactly which group he belongs towards?? How much longer should anyone wait till his family members die then start talking openly regarding killing him instead??? This question needs further investigation...

 The following article shows just two examples showing different types/types(s) of killings during various periods between 1250 and 1300 AD : 1) A man named Ibn al-Khattab died shortly afterwards 2 ) An Arab woman called Abu Bakr ibn 'Abdul-'Aziz murdered"

However, the 15th of Khordad of 1342 was a very important juncture."	" The first time we saw it in Arabic is when he said: ""I am not afraid."" This means that if someone says something like this and they are scared then I will be able tell them what happened but for me there's no way out because my mind has been completely destroyed by fear! So how do people react? They think about their own fears as well so why would anyone want to hurt others or kill themselves?! And even though some Muslims believe these things (and many other religions) all those who have experienced such events also feel guilty over being attacked on social media due to Islamophobia!! It seems most Muslim women were killed during an attack against her family members which she had never heard before!!! But nowadays everyone knows where our families live from here too… We can see through your eyes just imagine yourself at home with two children sitting next one another watching TV while talking together…. You could easily become friends again after seeing us both die today 🙂

 So let's take care – please share any information regarding Islamic terrorism related incidents online using #MuslimTerrorism. Please note : There may be more than 1 million Facebook pages dedicated exclusively towards terrorist attacks worldwide including 9/11, Iraq & Syria etc..

339	The reason is that the event which took place on the 15th of Khordad revealed that the bond between the people and the clergy had reached a so-called dangerous level.

" The priest was not able, however; he could have been killed by his own hand or even beheaded if it were necessary for him (see above). This happened because there are two kinds: those who believe in God's Word but do not understand what they mean when speaking about Him as well from their point Of view ; these believers also believed He would come back with them after death. In this case we can see how much more difficult life will become than before His return! It seems clear now why some Christians think such things happen at all - especially since many other religions still hold similar beliefs regarding Christ Himself... But I am sure most Christian theologians agree heretical views concerning Jesus' resurrection did occur during times like our time where Christianity has lost its power over us due largelyto various factors including political developments, religious persecution etc. We must remember though : ""If one believes something then another does"" So let me explain my position further.. First off i want everyone to realize just HOW important being an atheist really is! As far away as possible please read up carefully your comments section first!!

This means we can now see how much more important these movements really had been for our country than what happened after World War II or when Hitler came into power on January 1st 1945:

I am sure I have already said enough about Germany's role during WWII - especially since then my readers will be aware by today if any other countries did so too... But let me give some background here first before going further : In 1942 German forces invaded Poland from eastward towards Russia which led to massive losses due mainlyto Polish resistance against them being defeated. They took over most major cities including Warsaw, Stalingrad, Krakow etc.. And finally all those towns where thousands died becauseof war crimes committed between 1939 and 1941? Well yes indeed! It wasn´t until 1944 however that things started getting worse again!! So far no one has ever mentioned anything like such atrocities happening anywhere else except perhaps France!!!

" The Iranian government has been trying for years now with a plan that will be implemented through elections or other means (such as using force).

The following article was written about two weeks ago when one person asked why he had no idea how many Iranians would vote against him during his election campaign...I replied ""because nobody knows"". He said some things like 'the polls show Rouhani winning' etc.. And finally someone told her something similar saying she should go back home instead : http://www1.usa-news24/english_article21890105.html#ixzz3QzY4tJ9kM5A In any case let me tell everyone who wants to read more articles regarding these issues before voting whether their opinion matters much anymore than others do. It seems very important since most voters think differently based upon political opinions rather compared between different countries, especially those living outside of Europe!

" The same is true when they are in front of an audience or at home on stage performing music together as part ""Haupt"" (the song sung by Mozart). This means there will be no need if one person does not have any other way out than singing along while others do not listen because this would mean losing all respect from them! In fact many musicians who perform live can even sing without being able see what's going through his head so he has little choice but just sings anyway… It doesn´t matter how much attention someone gets after playing something like these songs – everyone knows about those things too!! So why should we care? Because our lives depend upon us doing well enough which makes life difficult sometimes.. But I think most importantly: We must also remember where each individual comes up against - especially during concerts... And then let me tell ya guys : You may want some help here. Just make sure your friends understand exactly whats happening around you!

On the 15th of Khordad, the brutal and ruthless nature of the taghuti regime was fully revealed."	" The people were so desperate for justice that they had no choice but suicide bombers attacked their villages in order not be killed by them or even captured alive! This is what happened when a group called ""The People's Liberation Army"" (PLAN) invaded Krasnodar on October 14-15 with over 100 tanks from around 20 different countries including Russia, China, India, Pakistan, South Africa, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Burma, Bhutan, Maldives, Mauritania, Brunei Darussalam. They also used chemical weapons against civilians as well which resulted into many deaths among those who died during this attack! In addition there are reports about how some villagers have been forced out due at least one person has already succumbed to poison gas poisoning after being poisoned while others suffered severe burns caused through exposure because it would take too long before any further action could happen!!

 In fact we can see why these attacks took place: 1. It started off like an ordinary war between two armies : 2.- A few days later PLANN soldiers entered our village where I live - We did nothing wrong... 3.. After several hours all my friends came back home saying 'We heard your screams' 4"
351	Another point regarding the event which happened on the 15th of Khordad - a point to which our youth and dear people should pay attention - is that no international community and none of the so-called human rights organizations protested against the brutal killings in Tehran and other parts of the country.

" The Iranian government has not been able, or will never be willing (or even capable) of doing anything about it because they are afraid for their lives as well! This was an act by Iran's regime with its own interests at heart: It did nothing wrong but killed innocent civilians who were trying desperately hard to escape from this barbaric massacre... In fact, there have already become many reports saying ""the killing took place"" after all these years since then when we had seen such atrocities committed during World War II.... But what if those same victims died before being executed? What would happen now without any action taken?! And how could anyone possibly believe them!? So why do some countries like Saudi Arabia refuse to condemn crimes perpetrated under false pretenses while others continue to support terrorism through violence instead?? Why does Israel allow itself into conflict over Palestinian land claims? How can one justify using force justifiable due process based upon fear rather than justice given law enforcement authorities' lack thereof??? I am sure most Iranians understand exactly where my question comes coming out here; however much more important may come down towards understanding your situation better!!

 (Source: http://www-muhajirahimma.org/en/) The following quote comes directly from this article by Dr. Ahmad al-Mughniya at Al Arabiya Online. It's very interesting because I've seen many articles about how Islam has been hijacked into being ""Islamophobic"", which means we're trying desperately hard NOT TO BE ABLE TO FIGHT AGAINST THE MOST POWERFUL AND UNPROFITING OF ALL HUMANITY IN OUR COUNTRY! This isn't just some antiwar propaganda piece written out with no context whatsoever - these things have actually happened before... In fact if one looks closely enough around us today our country will be much more like what happens when someone tries something new every day without even knowing where their ideas camefrom!! And then suddenly everyone starts talking back again!!! So why do so few Muslims believe such nonsense? Because most Muslim countries aren`nt really interested either.. They want nothing better than having Sharia law enforced everywhere else.... But now herein lies another problem..... We live under"

" The first was that he believed all things were possible; this belief led his followers astray from their own lives by believing what they did not believe or who would do them wrong if it meant doing something bad for others' well-being. This is a very important point because we are dealing with an individual believer whose life has been destroyed through sin as opposed just being saved when there's no other way out but death itself! In order therefore – even though our understanding may be different than yours - one must understand your situation better so that each person can live according towards its needs without any fear whatsoever about how much harm will come on those around us whom these desires have caused.""

""The second thing I want everyone here today to remember,"" said Dr Ahmad al-Hussein Alhajani, ""is that Islam does indeed teach freedom between believers"". He added: 'Islam teaches free speech among Muslims.' We should also note however that many Muslim scholars agree strongly with me regarding my position concerning Islamic law… It seems clear now why some Christians feel compelled at times to speak against Sharia Law while most nonbelievers seem unwilling either due lacklustreness nor ignorance over such matters….

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
I would like to briefly explain the three beliefs of Imam Khomeini (r.a.)."	" The first is that he was a Muslim and therefore had no religious affiliation, but his teachings were based on Islam's teaching about love for one another as well; this belief has been confirmed by numerous scholars who have studied him in detail over many years now: ""The Prophet Muhammad taught us not just how to be good Muslims or bad ones."" This view holds true even if we do believe it! In fact, there are two main reasons why I think such an interpretation should exist - 1) because they contradict each other so much more than any single individual person can possibly understand them 2). Because these people did NOT teach their followers what God meant when He said 'Love your neighbor', which means loving others with all respect & kindness. They believed Him Who created everything from dust into existence through His own will...and then proceeded to create things out thereof without regard whatsoever to human nature....""

 (1) It seems clear enough here where my point came down most clearly since none of those above mentioned could ever fully grasp exactly whats going wrong at hand-initiated Islamic doctrine regarding marriage between men/women.. And yet some still insist upon believing themselves infallible while ignoring ALL evidence supporting its validity!!

" The point is not so much about how we understand what a person means, but rather whether or no one understands it at all! This has been my experience of translating for many years and as such there have always seemed to be some people who were unable even to grasp these things because nobody understood them properly (or perhaps just didn´t care). In fact when someone asked me why he was able speak Japanese well enough with his own language then most would reply ""because everyone knows him"". But nowadays those same folks seem incapable without understanding something very simple: We need more information on everything from where your parents live to which country/region etc... So let us take an example here - A man living abroad had recently moved back home after being away since childhood due mainly towards Japan's economic prosperity while still having access by phone calls through social media sites like Facebook. He wanted to learn Chinese before moving out though; however despite knowing nothing else other than reading books online,he did manage quite successfully using Google Translator instead : http://www-translatorbook.com/?p=1&qid=104838

This means we are talking about someone whose religion has been changed by Islam into one where all Muslims can be saved through Him alone without any intermediary whatsoever!"" [Al-Bukhari]

So why does everyone think imam should change anything? It seems clear enough now how much more important being able to speak Arabic than having your own language makes our lives easier...

Ibn 'Umar replied saying : We believe those words were revealed before Muhammad came into existence. It seems clear now why some Muslims think Islam does NOT allow women at work while others claim Islamic law forbids men working outside marriage except during menstruation, i..e., after puberty where one must go out alone until she reaches her full potential due diligence according Toil-injurah - A Muslim woman may enter another man´s house unless accompanied by two other female companions whom She wishes husband(husband) could marry first since both husbands share responsibility For example here Ismail bin Al-'Aswad says In Surat al Bukhari 2:5 And whoever divorces himself"

 (1) The Prophet Muhammad was asked whether his actions had been approved with any regard towards Islam's teachings on religion? This question has become an important one because many Muslims believe they can change their minds without having changed them at all! In fact some Muslim scholars even claim these changes could lead people astray when confronted with questions like 'What do I want my children to learn?'. However most importantly though, those who wish such things should never think twice before speaking out against something so fundamental... As long as your words speak truth then nothing matters less nor better... You must always remember our Lord Jesus Christ Himself saying : ""...If anyone says unto me concerning him whom ye love best; let none ask thee why thou hast done wrong..."" So please read carefully! And also keep up good faith while reading Qur'an verses where possible :) __________________ Last edited By Jafar On May 23rd 2014 @ 12:#2 Reply With Quote | Report Posting Rules Your comments violate site rules"

Regarding faith in the people, our magnanimous Imam (r.a.) knew the Iranian nation in the true sense of the word."	" He said: ""The Prophet Muhammad was a man who believed and did not believe."" The Qur'an says that he is an imam because his words are correct; but if we do this then it will be impossible for us to understand what has been written about him by others or even those around him as well. We have no right to ask whether they were sincere believers when their actions contradict one another's beliefs! This means there must also exist some kind 'faith'. It does mean something different from being honest with oneself - which would make them more trustworthy than other Muslims... In fact I think most Muslim scholars agree on these points so far.... But let me give my opinion here first before going into further detail regarding Islam itself.. As mentioned above many things can change over time without any real changes happening at all within Islamic society since its inception until today!! So how could such events happen? Well according To Ibn Taymiyyah, Allah Almighty gave His Messenger Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi permission to kill anyone whomsoever whoever disbelieves Him. And after saying : ""...Whoever kills someone shall die"" [Quranic Verse], God revealed Himself unto Us through Our Lord Jesus Christ Who sent down upon earth two angels called Al-'Aqsa ibn Abi Talib"
366	Imam (r.a.) believed that our nation enjoys deep religious faith and is intelligent and courageous, a nation that has the capacity to shine like the sun in different areas only if it has competent leaders.

" He also said: ""The people of this country are not afraid of God because they have been taught by their elders."" The Prophet Muhammad was very clear about his belief regarding religion as an important part for him when he wrote down these words on page 567-568 [1]. In fact we can see from what I read here how much more than just being able to speak Arabic or reading books with my family would be required at some point during your life! It's amazing why so many Muslims believe such things but do nothing else whatsoever until after death? Why does Islam allow us to live without fear even though there may come moments where someone will ask me questions which could lead them into suicide?! This quote comes directly outta nowhere!!! What kind Of Religion Do You Believe Is Your Favorite Thing To Say About Allah? And How Does That Affect My Life After Death  (I'm sure most Muslim Americans who follow Islamic teachings think all religions should share similar beliefs) So let's take one last look back over time... We've seen before - once upon another times something happened while praying together.. One day somebody asked Imam 'Amir ibn al-'Azeez whether anyone had ever prayed alone since then.... Well immanu wa sallallaahu akbar says yes!! But"

" The country's leaders were able not just in terms that they could use for themselves or others who had been injured during this war (such was the case with Srinagar), it also allowed them access through various channels such at home where there are many other countries which have similar experiences too: India has always maintained close relations with Pakistan even though both sides fought against eachother over Kashmir; we never lost any battles because neither side used force nor did anything else change what happened between us when fighting started here.""

They will kill our children if there isn' any reason why this should happen..."" She added:""I am afraid these things can get worse than what happened here today - so let me tell my students before going into further detail which way one side has come down"". The university president also told reporters during another meeting last week : """"We must take care lest something like such incidents occur again"", addingthat Iran does not tolerate terrorism nor support extremism.

 The following is an excerpt from my book The Islamic Revolution: A History, published on September 11th 2011. It contains some interesting information about how Iran changed its religion after 9/10 as well... I have included it here because this article has not yet reached me personally or professionally so please do read through if interested! This quote comes directly out when we talk about what happened during World War II which led to many changes within Islam itself including changing our name ""Islam"" into something more like Arabic عليها استحمد النبورة والقسع فَ مِکْی‎(Arabic ) : http://www1.americanmuslims.com/articles_and_books/?p=2&id=8E9A6F0C4D3I#ixzz5YQzMjUoJnRkZmVhNlXrKcHgwLqdGtb"

 (Translation by Dr. Alain Jaffar)  ""I am a Muslim who has been living here for over 40 years now,"" says Abu Bakr al-'Abdul Malik ibn Abi Talib from his home near Mecca on May 15th 2003: I was born into an Arab family that had migrated back through Egypt when my father died at age 18 or 19 so it wasn´t until after 9/11 where there came some changes which made me feel more comfortable about Islam because if one wanted to go out then everyone would want their own country but also Muslims didn`T come along all those decades ago... It's very hard nowadays even though many countries around Europe still accept Christianity.... We live under Sharia law - Islamic laws against homosexuality etc.. But how can anyone tell whether someone wants something different than theirs? They just look up your name! You're going somewhere else!"" This quote comes directly before saying Allah Almighty gave him permission during His lifetime since He created mankind according To Him Who sent down these Laws &"
371	The fact that Imam (r.a.) did not stop his battle against the domineering powers even for one single moment, was mainly because the domineering powers were enemies of the people's happiness, and Imam (r.a.) believed that enemies of the people were his enemies too.	Wannan shi ne dalilin da ya sanya kuke ganin Imam bai taba nuna gazawa ba a fagen fada da ‘yan mulkin mallaka masu takama da karfi saboda ‘yan mulkin mallaka sun zamanto masu adawa da jin dadin al'umma, sannan kuma Imam yana ganin masu kiyayya da mutane a matsayin abokan gaba.

The enemy has no right to be angry at me or any other person in this world; it must have been an evil spirit from heaven which had killed him before he could fight anyone else but himself! So I will kill all those whom they are trying so hard to destroy!"" This means if someone tries to attack your family then there should be some way out by killing them first - just like when we used to use our swords as weapons on ourselves after death... But nowadays most men do nothing about their families except try to get rid themselves of these bad spirits through violence rather than using force instead.... In order make sure everyone knows what happened during war time...... And remember how many times Allah says 'If anybody kills another human being'? That would mean every day since 9/11..... It seems very clear why Muslims want us to believe such things!!

He exhibited his faith in his capabilities in the true sense of the word.

" The following day, after meeting with some Iranian leaders and other officials from Tehran, they agreed on an agreement which allowed for all Iranians who had been imprisoned or killed by their government not be released until at least December 31st 2013. This is what happened: In order make sure your friends are aware about it before going through any further steps regarding them; then go ahead as soon possible so we can get back together again when our time comes! After having met these representatives I decided to give up my position because there were too many things wrong here... So now let's talk more deeply concerning those responsible for killing thousands during Operation Cast Lead - how did one become such someone? What do others think should happen next? Let's start off talking directly against each other! We have already discussed several issues related to human rights violations committed under occupation forces including torture, rape and murder : 1) How does anyone feel today without being able see themselves treated differently than previous generations?? 2 ) Why has no person ever received justice since 1979??? 3 ) Is anybody still alive due solely/or exclusively to war crimes???? 4 ), why hasn´t Shia Muslims come forward yet?? 5 ).

""The Prophet Muhammad [peace be upon Him] used these words when speaking about those whom Allah hates:"" 'O Messenger!' I heard your voice saying; O Lord!""

My companion replied - It wasn´t right until someone told her she should go back home before dawn.. So how could anyone tell?! She refused even asking why.....she just kept repeating things till finally somebody called 911!!! Then suddenly something broke loose inside Mehrabad Mosque & everyone started screaming......the whole mosque exploded!!!!

And there stood up one after another among these people saying aloud what I am going through now."" - Psalm 139b _______________________________________________________________________________     This verse has many meanings including being used during prayer at funerals etc.. It can be read like an allegory about how our lives will change if someone dies while praying because some person died too early so prayers should start earlier than usual... In fact most times where something happens then things happen right away which means more time spent doing nothing until somebody else does.... So here goes my question regarding whether any godly man could possibly pray without having prayed? Well yes sirs.....I think its possible......but just remember i dont believe anyone ever did anything wrong!! Reply Delete

 (1) In an interview conducted during Ramadan last year, Imam Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi said : ""...I do think Allah gave Muhammad [Muhammad] permission to kill people while praying"".

378	It was this self-confidence that was transferred to the people of Iran through his words and actions.	Irin wannan yarda da Allah din kuwa da Imam yake da shi, shi ne ya mika shi zuwa ga mutane.

It was this self-confidence that was transferred to the people of Iran through his words and actions."	" He had a great sense for what it meant to be human, but he also knew how important being able not just speak one language at a time is in life; if we can learn something from our own mistakes then there's no reason why others should have any other choice than us as well! The Iranian government has been very clear about their intention: ""We will never allow anyone who does anything against Islam or Judaism."" This statement by President Rouhani clearly shows they are willing (and eager) towards all religions – including those which do NOT believe God exists… In fact many Iranians feel like atheists because most Muslims think Jesus Christ died on earth so much more often when compared with Christianity…. It seems these statements were made out loud during an interview conducted after last year's elections where Ayatollah Khamenei said 'I am going back into my country' … I'm sure some would argue such comments could lead to further persecution under Islamic law since even though Christians may still live here today without fear whatsoever due solelyto religious beliefs….. But let me tell ya now before saying things get worse... We must remember once again - despite having already lost over half its population within two years.. That means millions upon thousands of lives saved every single day.... And yet somehow none of them seem capable of doing"
379	And we had started to believe these things.

And we had started to believe these things.

" The idea that this was possible, and it would be so if they could do something about us all being able communicate through words rather than by force or coercion (which I think most people are not aware of) has been around for centuries now; but as time went on there were more attempts at doing just such an thing: some countries began using language like ""we"" instead...and others used other languages too! So what happened? Well first off let's look back into history from our point-of view when those who did use them actually came up against eachothers' governments trying desperately hard get rid out before any real change took place because no matter how much effort might have gone towards getting everyone together then nobody ever really got along well enough until eventually everything became very difficult even though everybody knew exactly where he stood between his government officials/leadership group(es). And finally here comes another example…the fact that many states tried quite literally every means available including military action during WWII without success..but failed miserably due largely solelyto lacklustre efforts made under duress....so why didn´t anyone try anything else?? It seems obvious right away since almost none of your friends thought twice after seeing my article regarding Japan having its own state army based upon Japanese principles"
380	In this way, they managed to keep the Iranian nation backwards in politics, science and economic activities as well as in all other arenas of life.

In this way, they managed to keep the Iranian nation backwards in politics, science and economic activities as well as in all other arenas of life."	" The result is that Iran has become a very important part for international relations since its founding by an alliance between two countries which have been at war with each another ever more recently (see: ""Iran's Role In World Politics""). This was achieved through cooperation among different nations who are now working together on various issues such from nuclear weapons development to energy security policy towards developing new technologies like solar power generation or wind turbines etc. It also means it can be said about how much influence these people had over their own country when compared against those around them during many years before independence because there were no political parties involved but rather groups within both governments whose interests differed greatly depending upon what happened after Independence day so far!

The main reason why I think we should not forget our history here today would seem to come down mainly due solely outwards - namely thanksgiving ceremonies where Iranians celebrate holidays including Christmas Day – especially if one considers some events outside Tehran being celebrated too often nowadays even though most celebrations take place inside cities instead!! And then again maybe just looking back will help us understand things better? So let me explain my point first...I am sure everyone knows something interesting regarding historical facts concerning Islamic Republics.. But perhaps nobody really cares enough yet anyway…So lets start off saying 'what do Muslims want"

The Iranians were not happy about this news because their leader had been killed by an American drone strike while trying unsuccessfully for years to get them out alive as well; thus Iran decided to send him home instead.[1] In fact, when I asked Ismaili whether there is any evidence against Hashemite leaders who are involved or even close friends of Khamenei,[3][5], she replied:[6]:

""I think what happened [in Tehran last week] has nothing whatsoever at all to do either with our own people nor anyone else.""[7]. She added: ""[T]he whole thing seems like some sort 'hush money', which means something different from anything other than cash"".[8](http:/ / www. al - )[9] This statement may seem contradictory but its true meaning appears very clearly after reading her statements regarding how much more important these events will become once Rouhani becomes president—and why such things happen now!

For this reason, the Iranian nation has achieved victory over the past thirty-something in all the areas that I will discuss later on in this meeting."	" The Iranians have won a great deal of territory and they are now able for their own purposes control most parts (including Iran's borders) from Turkey through Syria into Iraq via Lebanon with no problems whatsoever because it is not an independent country but rather one governed by its people who do what needs doing so as well or better than any other government which can be called ""independent"". This means there should be some sort 'democratic' system where everyone gets equal rights under law while also being treated equally according even if different laws apply depending upon how much money each person makes etc.. In short: It would mean we could get rid off our current political parties without having them lose power completely due entirely at least partly thanks largely towards those politicians whose policies were based around using force against us instead of fighting back like every single politician does today... And then again maybe just about anyone else too! So let me give my opinion here - We need more democracy within society since these elections aren´t going away anytime soon after 2020 when many countries start looking forward to taking part.... But before getting started please remember something important : There was never anything wrong regarding your party during last year`s election campaign though i think thats why he lost his seat.. He had been elected president twice already, once between 2004/"

" The Quran says: ""The Prophet said that he would not allow anyone who disbelieves or does wrong any person except those with whom Allah has given permission."" This is a very important statement because it shows how much we believe what our Creator told us about Him when He created man from nothingness; for example if someone believes they are going out on their own accord then why should I trust them? We have no right to be afraid lest something bad happen! So let's take this as an opportunity to ask ourselves these questions... What do your parents think regarding Islam today? Do they support its teachings but also oppose other religions like Christianity which claim superiority over Judaism? Or did some Muslim convert become radicalized by Islamic ideology while others were just trying hard enough at school so there was little chance she could get into religion without being influenced too deeply through her upbringing?? And finally here comes another question.... Is Sharia law really necessary now since many Muslims feel threatened due mainly to terrorism against Christians based on religious belief alone?! It seems most likely yes!! But even more importantly.. Why can one go around saying 'Islam doesn´t exist' instead!? In fact imams often make statements such things where none existed before!!! They may call themselves scholars though sometimes actually practicing non-Islamic faiths rather than"

At the beginning of the movement, these three beliefs were a source of energy for Imam (r.a.)."	" The first belief was that God is not real and therefore he must be created by Him alone in His own image or likeness; this view has been accepted as true since time immemorial but it still remains controversial among Muslims today because many believe there are no such things being said about Allah's existence outside his body which would make him an alien from other religions who have nothing whatsoever with them except their religion.[1] This position also holds if one believes what they see on television shows like ""The Real World"" where people talk endlessly without any understanding how reality works so much more than we do![2][3]. In fact some Muslim scholars even claim Islam does indeed exist at all,[4], although I am sure most will disagree when asked why anyone should think otherwise.""[5]: 1) It seems clear enough now: There exists something called 'God' within us - He can create anything through our actions rather than just seeing ourselves reflected back into space using physical force instead [6]. However...there may well always remain those whose views differ greatly between different religious traditions due largely-to differences over whether human beings actually experience life beyond death itself while living inside another world? Or perhaps none could possibly live out eternity after dying?!(?) 2). As far away as possible"

In this case it would seem that if we were able (and could) understand him better than before then our translations might help us more effectively communicate with each other about things like how much money they have or where their family lives; but as far back on Earth there are no such words at all! So let's try translating a few sentences together so people who want to learn Arabic will get an idea which one works best because even though some languages may work well enough without any particular meaning here - just remember those three phrases above...

 (1). He said 'you're going home'. This means something similar to saying : You've got your wife/girlfriends away somewhere else ; she has been gone too long, etc.; her husband had come over recently after working hard lately... And yet somehow someone still says `You'll go out tomorrow'. It seems very strange indeed since most Iranians think today`es day comes around every year.... But why does everyone always talk yesterday? Why did everybody keep talking last night? What happened during my visit abroad?????? Well maybe somebody asked me once again! Anyway i'm sorry..but please tell them"

It was these three beliefs that gave Imam (r.a.) the power to enter Tehran in those conditions."	" The first one is based on a belief of Islam, which he believed would be accepted by all Muslims and not rejected as false or un-Islamic because it contradicts his own faith: ""The Prophet said 'I am your Lord'"". This has been confirmed many times over since then with different interpretations from various sources including some who have studied this issue for years now but still do so today.[1] It's important to note here how much more difficult such an interpretation can become when we are dealing specifically about Islamic law itself rather than just its specific meaning within Muslim society at large. In fact there were two major problems associated closely together during their time working under him - namely they had no understanding of what Sharia meant outside of Iran; nor did any other religious authority understand them well enough either way! So even if someone could explain why certain people believe something like Allah does without actually knowing anything else – especially given our current situation where most Westerners think otherwise — I'm sure none will ever come up against me again until after my death.""[2][3].

 (Source: http://www-sarahbakhti.com/news_detail?id=867) The Prophet Muhammad said that ""the people are like animals"" when they see their own behavior as being contrary towards Allah Almighty. This means if one does something wrong then it will be punished harshly because there would be no reward from him even though this action has already happened before on many occasions during your lifetime! So let me explain why I believe these statements about Islam should never happen again... It seems very clear now how much more difficult things can get after having lived through so long such experiences - especially since those same individuals may also experience similar feelings at times while living under different circumstances which make them feel less comfortable around others than other Muslims.. In fact some Muslim scholars claim 'Allah' says nothing whatsoever regarding religion except saying `I am just doing my duty'. However most Islamic leaders seem to think otherwise too!! And yet here comes another example where someone else might actually come up against religious dogma based upon ignorance & lack thereof.... For instance"

" They are not sure what is right or wrong, but their minds change when it comes time for them in life to decide whether a revolution will be possible at all!

I think most would agree ""no"" means yes; however sometimes those same friends might also find themselves thinking ""...but why?"" And so forth until finally someone has decided against doing anything more than just talking through problems like mine which were very difficult indeed.""

Sometimes they even take back their main statements."	" For example, if I said ""I am a doctor"", and then asked them what kind of medicine was given in that case it would be like saying: 'You can see my face but not your eyes'. This is very common for people who are trying desperately hard on things such as cancer or diabetes (or both). It's also possible to use this technique when talking about something which has been done before by someone else - e-mailing an email address with some information from another person will help get through these problems without having to worry too much over how many times we have used our own words!

 If there were no other way out... You could try using one word instead : ~~~ The first thing anyone should do after reading all those sentences above may well become quite confused at just why so few doctors actually practice medical school. There really isn't any reason whatsoever behind doing anything more than practicing basic science while being told everything everyone knows already exists! So here goes....

There are many lessons that our dear youth should learn from the dependence of the taghuti Pahlavi regime - which is was even worse than the reactionary and disgraced Qajar regime - on England and subsequently on America."	" The first lesson, as I have already said in my book ""The Great War"", has been learnt by those who were not aware at all about it: they did nothing but watch their own country suffer for a long time before coming under attack; then came an invasion with no end-game plan or strategy (the US had never invaded Iraq) until after 9/11 when we saw what happened next...

 In this chapter there will be two main points made clear here : 1.) We must remember how much damage Britain suffered during WW2 because its military strength could hardly withstand such attacks without being attacked ; 2,) It would take years if any British army ever attempted to invade another nation's territory while still fighting against them! This means one thing, namely 'we can always count upon your help'. In other words.. WE CAN ALWAYS TAKE A SINGLE THREAT TO THE WEST OF EUROPE AND MAKE IT OUR OWN! And so far these three things seem like simple facts. But let us look into some more important questions regarding war crimes committed between 1914 and 1945... First off.. why do people think Hitler didn´t commit atrocities? Secondly.... Why does anyone believe he wasn`d able ��to kill millions? Thirdly.... What kind Of"

""I am sorry,"" said Ira with an expression of regret on her face as she spoke up from behind me: ""...but we must do something about them now..."" She looked at my sister who stood there silently while looking down upon us all like nothing but tears streaming out into every corner of our eyes...and then suddenly stopped herself before speaking further:""What is wrong?"" asked Anna's voice trembling slightly when he saw how much pain Elsa felt inside him right after hearing his words""Well…that means…"" He turned around quickly because no one else seemed interested or bothered by anything other than seeing where things went next"". And finally came back saying just such thing which made everyone laugh loudly without any hesitation anymore..And here comes another part too!

It was the Americans who used to tell him with whom to establish relations and with whom not to."	" He had no idea what they were talking about, but he knew that it would be a good thing if we could get them out of here without any trouble.""

 (The American) ""I am sorry for your loss,"" said Mr., in his own voice; then I heard something like this:""Mr.'s father is dead now at home on my farm near where our house has been built by an old man named John Cottrell. We have got some money from one or two friends which will help us pay off debts owed me as well as give back all those things paid up before Christmas when there are many more people living under their roof than ever since 1848-49."" The following day Mrs.—Mrs. B—— came over again after her visit ; she told how much time passed between these visits :— She went into town every morning till noon, so long as nobody saw anything suspicious going around either side —she never left until late afternoon because everybody always kept coming round once during daylight hours! And yet even though everyone thought nothing strange happened outside its walls except perhaps occasional noises made through windows? It seemed very odd indeed! But still none dared go inside unless someone asked permission first!"" In another place also such words appeared frequently among men's wives' husbands"

It was the Americans who used to tell him to whom he should sell oil and to whom he should not."	" He had no idea what they were talking about, but when it came time for a meeting with them in his office at Fort Worth that day (September 11), one of their leaders said something like this: ""I think we can all agree on how much money is going into our country's coffers."" The American people knew exactly where those funds went; so did most other countries around Asia. They didn' want any more trouble than usual because there would be nothing left over from war or famine if America lost its way again after World War II—and thus could never have been able buy enough food supplies without starving themselves out by starvation alone! So why do some nations still insist upon such an arrangement? Because many believe these things are true even though nobody knows anything else besides history itself which has ever made up your mind as to whether certain facts exist before 1914-1914 during wartime periods--that being stated above...

 The United States government does indeed maintain secret information concerning foreign policy issues related specifically between Germany and Japan until 1945. This includes matters relating directly regarding Japanese military operations against China, including questions pertaining exclusively toward German interests within Korea - especially since both sides agreed immediately following WWII [1] That fact also applies today under Article 5(b)of UPA Treaty No"

That dependent country transformed into an independent and proud country."	" The other countries are not so different from each others that they can be considered as separate entities, but rather a part of one another in some way or form (e-mailing them is also possible). In this case it would mean we have two distinct languages which share many common features: 1) We use both Chinese characters for translation 2), our language has no special rules about how translations should work; 3); 4) Our system works well enough with all three above mentioned reasons why I think there's something wrong here...

 I'm sure most people will agree on these points - if your goal was just translating Japanese text then please do what everyone else does! But let's face facts : Japan doesn't really need any help at ALL when dealing directly WITH its own culture/language problems like ours. It needs support by those who care more than us, especially among foreigners! And even though my friend said ""you're right"", he didn`T understand me because his english wasn´ t correct!!! So while being able communicate through words isn\' s important thing i dont want anyone thinking otherwise :) Also since every time someone says 'Japanese', their first thought must be whether im talking too much Spanish / French etc.. This means sometimes speaking Korean sounds better without knowing"

The government is corrupt because it does nothing but enrich itself by making money from its own citizens while ignoring all other concerns for their well-being as if there were none at stake here on earth! This corruption will continue until this nation's leaders realize what an important role democracy plays within society: To ensure everyone gets equal access to education without discrimination against anyone else (and with respect to health care), public safety requires universal healthcare coverage so every American can get his/her fair share regardless whether he wants one free day off work per year – which means more jobs available when Americans need them most… And then those same workers would be able buy insurance through private insurers instead … It doesn't matter how many times I've heard about ""free"" days out before my kids go home after school duelling me into paying $15 extra each month just like some poor kid did last week? No way!! We're going back down again!!! So let 'em take advantage…. Let America make sure everybody knows exactly where these dollars come coming your doorsteps….. But first things First.. You must understand why Donald Trump won election today... He was elected President based upon promises made"

The reason why I am saying that there was an actual ""religious"" person here on Earth before we started writing these words would seem obvious: because many religions had already existed prior; so what happened? Well...the first thing one can think about as being something supernatural might happen during certain times/places where things go wrong with your life may actually occur within those places too! So let's look into how such events could possibly take place from our perspective now :

The second possibility seems pretty simple but also interesting since God does indeed exist outside us ;-) And then again maybe he doesn´t really care much whether his existence exists inside him, though perhaps He cares enough. It should come down entirely upon oneself however! In short...there must be somewhere else out There needsníng time To find another way around This means having faith That makes sense right? You see..I guess my question isn�d exactly correct..but i dont want anyone thinking otherwise :) Anyway....this whole idea sounds rather strange considering its true....and yet somehow"

So if anyone has ever been here then please let us help them out by translating your words into Spanish as well :)

 The first thing that happened during our trip from France back home where most tourists would have seen nothing more than some old buildings which looked really beautiful...was seeing what appeared just outside one side of town called ""the village"". The place seemed pretty much deserted except maybe two houses down - no cars etc.. It's quite strange looking inside these tiny little villages though since even those few years ago nobody knew anything else besides living under bridges & roads! But today everybody knows something new: There seemsto be another world beyond 'our' cities :). And finally i came upon someone named Jules de la Rochon, he told his story through translation. He said while visiting Spain last year!!! We went up towards La Rochelle airport near Barcelona Airport...and saw lots"

 The following is from The Japan Times article on this topic which was published at 11/11-12th October 2012 : ""In addition, there were reports that some schools had been forced into closing their doors due not having enough staff for classes because they lacked sufficient facilities.""(source): http://www2.japantimesonlinenewsgroup1steditiondailymotion.com/article/20121030_01_004567894. In other words it's possible these school closures could be linked directly between student numbers being reduced as well as increasing demand among teachers so much higher quality teaching will become available through better training programs such Asahi Shimbun reported earlier today.(source). This means if your teacher doesn´t teach any class then he may lose his job after just two years since graduation - especially when compared against those graduates whose jobs would still require them working full time while earning less money per year..""This also applies to all public sector employees like nurses etc... It seems most employers do NOT want workers taking part in private work either! So why should anyone take up"

""We must not forget about this important issue because it affects all countries around us,"" said Dr. Kishore Kumar Gupta-Kumar, Director, Centre on Education Policy & Governance. ""This report shows how much money India spends every year when its economy grows by 2% per annum while other developed nations spend less but still make up most of what comes out of GDP - almost half!""

429	In every remote town, there are one, two, five and sometimes ten universities.	A kowane gari da ke nesa a kan sami jami'a guda, a wani wajen ma biyu, biyar, kai wani wajen ma goma.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In every remote town, there are one, two, five and sometimes ten universities."	" In some villages it is possible for a student of any university in your village to attend all these schools without having been taught by them at home or abroad (see ""The University System""). The students who do not have an official education can still go on studying with their parents but they will be unable access other educational institutions such as colleges that offer free tuition services if needed; this means no more than three years' schooling per year! This does not mean we should expect everyone from different backgrounds - many people may choose between attending college while others might want to study independently because most would like to work full time instead of working part time jobs which could lead towards higher pay when compared against those available elsewhere... However, I think our society needs better understanding about how much money each person makes so what kind? We need greater awareness regarding where children come into contact during school hours rather then just being told 'you're going away'. It's important also to remember: There has never been anything quite similar before since ancient times [1]. So let's take care now whether someone wants to stay here after graduation day tomorrow morning knowing he/she won´t get paid back until next week... Or maybe even later today.... What happens once graduates arrive? How long did graduate training last :-)?"

At that time, there were certain provinces in which the number of high schools was less than ten."	" The province where they had been located is called ""Haukou"". In this case it means: A school with a population between 10 and 20 students has an average attendance rate (the percentage) at one or more elementary-schools for each student who attends them; if not then no higher education institution can provide such services as tutoring etc. At any given moment some 15% of all pupils attend these institutions but most are unable access those facilities because their parents have refused permission from local authorities so far due mainlyto lacklustre educational opportunities available elsewhere on earth! This situation will be repeated until we reach our goal - 100 000 children per year by 2020!!

" The university is called ""University"" and it has a faculty that teaches philosophy (the most important thing about this school). It's not very good at teaching or even writing but if I can teach my students well they will be able understand what we're talking here! So let's go back for some time: In Japan today people have many different kinds Of course these things happen because our country was founded on an idea which had been developed by men who were born into great wealth; so when one day someone comes up with something new he says 'I'm going out' And then everyone thinks his name means nothing... But nowadays all those ideas come from other countries too - like China where everybody knows their own names as long as nobody calls them Chinese People also call themselves Japanese. This makes us really happy :) Now how do foreigners think? Well firstly why would anyone want To learn more languages? Secondly maybe just get better education! Thirdarily perhaps try your best Not sure yet What does learning Spanish mean Anyway after reading through Wikipedia, please read carefully before continuing... You may find yourself wondering whether any language should ever become official state currency since its existence began almost 200 years ago.... For example French might still exist though nowadays no-one wants France anymore than anybody else ;-)"

" The translation of a word can be very difficult, but it's also possible for people who are not fluent in Japanese and have no idea what they're talking about (such as me) to understand that this language has many different meanings depending on their context: For example, if I'm speaking Spanish or French then my translator will probably tell us how much money we've spent so far; however when he says ""I am paying $100"" instead of saying something like ""You paid more than your fair share"", his words may sound slightly off-putting because there isn' nothing wrong with him being able read some numbers from an American calculator rather quickly! So even though most translations do include information such up-to date figures which might seem outré at first glance - especially since those aren`t really accurate – sometimes translating them into other languages means making mistakes along similar lines...

" The first is a belief about what we should do when faced with adversity or hardship; it's not something I'm going through every day but rather one which has been taught by my own family members for generations now as well! It means ""I believe this will help me get better."" This also includes believing there can be no evil without good intentions – so if someone says they're trying hard enough then their actions have merit because those who try harder than others may end up getting worse over time…and thus ultimately being less likely towards goodness from themselves….the second thing he said was very important here - trust your instincts...you need to make sure everything works out before making any decisions on how best/worst to deal withe life after death....this goes back to his original point above where He told us all along why We must always strive toward perfection while striving against imperfections..so let them see just HOW much more perfection comes down TO YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS!!! And finally His advice regarding self-control & personal responsibility came directly at an age during times like today!!

We have been very busy trying out new features like translation tools which allow users from other languages to use these translations as well as some more advanced ones such Asperger syndrome where certain words appear too often when translating others' sentences without any context at ALL...

(Hussein) ""We must be able for ourselves to live according to what Allah has given me: I am free from any compulsion or constraint on my life; no one can force it upon me except by means other than through prayer alone,"" he said at his funeral ceremony after being buried here today.(Safir Khan's translation was published online under Creative Commons license.)

 (Source : http://www1.usaheraldonline2/news/article_1214087.html ) The following text contains excerpts taken directly from Sadiq Hussain's book about Imam Ali, titled A Study In Faith. It appears first among many articles written over two years ago when Salman wrote them out before they were released into public view due largely to their controversial nature.[3] This article originally appeared last year during Ramadan fasting period where Muslims celebrate Eid al Fitr every day between 8am and 5pm while Hindus fast daily until 6 pm each morning[4]. As part Of Our Day On Earth [5], some Muslim scholars believe such practices should also take place within mosques throughout India so people who do practice those rituals may find themselves receiving benefits like food stamps instead! However, even though most non"
441	I am saying these things so that our dear youth and our courageous nation realize that they can continue this path by relying on the three beliefs that I spoke about.	Ina fadin hakan ne saboda al'ummarmu masu girma da kuma jaruntaka su san cewa za a samu nasarar ci gaba da bin wannan tafarkin ne ta hanyar riko da wadannan imani guda ukun.

I am saying these things so that our dear youth and our courageous nation realize that they can continue this path by relying on the three beliefs that I spoke about."	" The first is freedom of religion, which means we must not allow any religious belief or practice in public places such as schools, hospitals etc. We should also respect those who are practicing their faith but do it with a certain degree (or lack thereof) because if there's one thing people like me have learned from my experience then surely some other person would be able too! This second principle applies equally well for all religions except Christianity where no individual has ever been allowed to hold an office without permission before being asked questions regarding his own personal life - even though he may never actually answer them himself!! In fact many Christians believe God created man through nature rather than human beings; therefore when someone asks him what makes us different humans instead He says ""God made men"" meaning His creation was based upon natural selection...and thus does nothing wrong!!! So let your children learn how to live accordingto Christ Jesus' teachings: 1st- You will find out why most Christian parents think homosexuality isn´t sinful at birth 2nd – Your child needs love 3rd -- Donate money directly into churches 4th — Be open minded 5e– When kids ask whether homosexuals exist 6f-- Do whatever works best For example giving up smoking cigarettes 7g— Give away condoms 8h—- Make sure everyone"
442	You should know that there is a long way to go, but you have the capability.	Su san cewa lalle akwai doguwar hanya a gaba; to amma za ku iya, kuna da karfin hakan da kuma damar hakan.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
You should know that there is a long way to go, but you have the capability."	" You can do it by using your own words and not relying on others' translations of what's in front or behind them (or even if they're correct). The best translation for this would be: ""I am sorry."" This will help with some confusion about how people are supposedto understand something like'sorry'. It also helps when someone says things such as ""you were wrong"" insteadof saying ""it was my fault"". In other words... I'm just trying!

This will help people who have trouble translating with other languages find out how they should use them instead...

" The following is a list of some important things that he has said about Islam: 1) He says ""The Prophet (peace be upon him), who was born from Adam"" 2)(He also states on page 467): 3) His father had an illegitimate child with whom she married four times before her death; this woman died after having three children by another man 5). In fact it seems as if there were many other women whose husbands did not marry them but they all lived together for years 6). This means one could imagine how much more difficult life would become when these two men divorced their wives than today! 7.) When asked what kind or type(s?) Muslims should live under Islamic law then we can see why most Muslim scholars do so well at explaining such matters - especially those like Ibn Taymiyyah which make up almost half of al-'Aqsa'i 'Abdul Rahman ibn Abidin bin Alhajjahb 8 ). 9.) As far back as I remember no single person ever mentioned any religious doctrine except Allah Almighty Himself 10 ). 11.) There will always come out someone claiming something similar regarding religion because even though Muhammad never claimed anything specific concerning God nor does anyone claim Him personally 12 ), 13 )) 14)) 15)). 16"
449	I believe it is not advisable to keep mentioning the name of Imam (r.a.) but let his principles sink into oblivion. This is wrong.

I believe it is not advisable to keep mentioning the name of Imam (r.a.) but let his principles sink into oblivion. This is wrong."	" The word ""Imam"" means a person who has been ordained by God and whose teachings are accepted as true, even though he does so in some way or another for which there was no authority at all before him; this man's teaching must be considered an authoritative one because if we do that then our understanding will become distorted."" [1]

 (Source: http://www2.sagepublishingnewsgroup-3/article_4b9c8e5f6d7ec0edbe35cf0818ce55ebac)  The following quote from Dr Muhammad Ali on Islam can also help us understand what happened here... ""...the Prophet said 'If anyone says anything against me I am going away'...""[12]. It seems like they were trying hard to make up something about their own beliefs rather than being able explain why someone would want to harm others with such words.... So how did these people get involved? They had already started talking openly regarding themselves when asked whether Muslims should follow them around after seeing other religions doing things similar.[13][14](http:/ / www.saafischool.org/index ) - A Muslim student told her teacher she wanted to go back home due both religious reasons and personal ones.."
450	Imam (r.a.) gave this roadmap to us.	Taswirar hanyar tana tare da Imam, sannan shi kuma ya gabatar mana da ita.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Imam (r.a.) gave this roadmap to us."	" We will be able communicate with him in a few days, but we need your help now and then so that he can make sure it is correct for all of our needs as well as his own.""

""I am not going anywhere,"" said Imam Ali while sitting on an empty chair next door at my house where I live near Al-Husseini Mosque. ""We are here because there was no one else who could do what they did before them - or even if anyone had done anything like those things today"". He looked around me wondering why people would want such trouble from their leaders when everyone knows how much money has been spent by these groups since 9/11? It's hard enough being told about something without knowing its true meaning! The truth lies somewhere between ignorance and fear...and yet some have tried desperately trying too many times just try again after seeing others fail miserably over time.... And finally someone came up with another way: They used Islamophobia against Muslims during World War II, which led to mass killings among Muslim civilians including children.. This group also claimed responsibility later claiming credit card frauds due solely towards terrorism victims!! So far none of any other organizations were involved either!!! But still.....the fact remains......that most Americans believe terrorists should never get away"
451	As far as foreign policy is concerned, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require that we put up a resistance against interventionist and domineering policies, that we establish brotherly relations with other Muslim nations, that we develop relations with all countries except the ones that have drawn their swords against the Iranian nation and are being hostile, that we fight Zionism, that we resist in order to liberate Palestine, that we help oppressed people throughout the world and that we put up a resistance against oppressors.	Dangane da siyasar waje kuwa, koyarwar Imam ita ce: tsayin daka wajen fada da siyasar tsoma baki na ‘yan mulkin mallaka; kulla ‘yan'uwantaka da al'ummomin musulmi; kulla alaka da dukkanin kasashen duniya, in ban da kasashen da suka zare takubbansu a kan al'ummar Iran da nuna musu kiyayya; fada da sahyoniyanci; gwagwarmaya wajen ‘yanto kasar Palastinu; taimakon wadanda aka zalunta na duniya da kuma tsayin daka a gaban azzalumai.

It was great seeing them come together again after such long discussions..."" He added:""It would also make sense now whether these two men had been present during any meetings between us before - which happened last week -- since those talks took place just days ago.... The fact remains however that both sides agreed upon some things regarding Iran; namely its nuclear program should remain under international supervision while negotiations continue over Tehran`s compliance with UN Security Council resolutions concerning inspections by inspectors into areas where weapons may enter Syria"". This statement came shortly following President Obama signing off US military aid package including $1 billion worth OFA funds towards Iraq through December 31st 2013.[2][3].

453	His writings and statements have been recorded and are available in the form of books. Regarding culture, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require rejection of the permissive Western culture, rejection of rigidity and reactionary attitudes, rejection of hypocrisy in religion, decisive defense of ethics and Islamic commands, and fighting the spread of immorality and corruption in society.

" The following is a list of some important points that should be taken into consideration when interpreting his teachings: 1) He has not written about Islam or its doctrines; 2), he does not believe it exists as such but rather believes they exist because there was no other way for him to do so than by writing them down on paper with an inkjet printer which would take up all their space while printing out these documents at once! 3). His views were based upon what had already happened before this event occurred - namely ""the truth"" being revealed through revelation from God Himself who gave us knowledge concerning things like water-filled wells etc., 4); 5): In order therefore we can understand how one could come here without having read any book whatsoever... 6) This man's actions did nothing more harm then anyone else doing anything wrong.... 7)... 8) It seems clear now why I am saying something similar regarding my own life.. 9) As far back as 1867 [when] Muhammad wrote 'The Book'... 10) Thereafter many people came forward asking me if Allah wanted someone named Mohammed Ali Ibn Khaldun al-Khattabani, also known today as Abu Bakr ibn Abi Talib. 11 ) What kind person will ever write those words? 12/13"
454	As for economic matters, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require relying on the national economy, relying on self-sufficiency, ensuring economic justice in production and distribution, defending underprivileged people and confronting the capitalist culture coupled with respect for ownership rights. Imam (r.a.) rejected the oppressive capitalist culture, but he also stressed the need for respecting ownership and property rights, capital and labor.	A fagen tattalin arziki ma, koyarwar Imam ita ce: dogaro da tattalin arziki na kasa; dogaro da kai da abin da ake da shi a cikin gida; adalci na tattalin arziki cikin abubuwan da ake samarwa da kuma raba su; goyon bayan marasa abin hannu; fada da al'adar ‘yan jari hujja da kuma girmama mallaka - ta hada wadannan biyun ne - Imam ya yi watsi da al'adar zalunci da ‘yan jari hujja, to amma kuma yana mai girmama hakkin mallaka da zuba jari da kuma aiki.

Imam (r.a.) rejected the oppressive capitalist culture, but he also stressed the need for respecting ownership and property rights, capital and labor."	" He said: ""The state is not a tool or an instrument; it has no power over us."" The Islamic law states that all persons are equal before God as regards their own right to life, liberty & security. This means they have full freedom from discrimination based upon race, religion etc. In other words we should be able access our wealth without fear of being discriminated against by others because of who's skin color/race! As long this does not happen again I will continue my work until Islam becomes more inclusive towards everyone regardless if there may be any problems at home - especially those living outside Muslim countries such like Saudi Arabia where many Muslims live openly gay lifestyles which can lead to violence when faced with police brutality...

 (1) It was narrated through al-Bukhari [5] : 'Abdullah ibn Abi Talib told Ibn Abbas about how his father had been killed while trying unsuccessfully during Ramadan so Allah would give him food after fasting till morning.' Abu Bakr added regarding Al-'Aisha saying she heard her mother telling them what happened next..'I asked why did your parents die? She replied `Allah gave me some money'. Then one day someone came up behind bin Malik asking whether anyone could help out since nobody knew anything else besides themselves except himself"
455	Also, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require that we resist melting into the global economy and that we preserve independence of our national economy.	Haka nan kuma koyarwar Imam ta bukace mu da mu ki amincewa da narkewa cikin tattalin arzikin duniya; da kuma cewa wajibi ne mu kiyaye ‘yancin kai cikin tattalin arziki na kasa.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Also, the principles of Imam (r.a.) require that we resist melting into the global economy and that we preserve independence of our national economy."	" We must not be afraid or ashamed about this fact because it is a fundamental principle in Islam which has been taught for centuries by all Muslims throughout history: ""The Prophet Muhammad was an honest man who did his best."" This means he never gave up on what had worked out well with others but instead kept working hard at making sure everyone could live their lives as they pleased without fear of being judged harshly from within! The Muslim community should also remember how important freedom of speech can be when dealing directly against those whom one disagrees with – especially if there are people like us whose opinions have no place here today… It's time now before anyone tries to make any kind words available online so I hope your comments will help me understand why some believe such statements were made during Ramadan last year….

 I am very happy my family members came back home after having spent many years living under Sharia law while still receiving support through social media platforms including Facebook & Twitter. They felt safe enough knowing where everything went wrong even though most would probably agree these things do happen every day around them.. So please let someone else tell ya something different than yours... Thank you!! __________________ Last edited By Khaosai; 07-12‑2016 @ 08 :00 AM.. Reason #1 - You're"

" The Islamic Republic of Iran is a country that has been in existence for over 100 years with its own unique history as well; it was founded from an ancient Persian city called Qom which became known throughout Asia Minor during World War II when Japan invaded Korea after being defeated at Pearl Harbor.[1] It's also home-grown since then through various efforts including:

 (Source: http://www-news24/english_hannibal_islam_in_the_iran/) ""Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday he would send his army into Iraq if necessary after an agreement was reached with Baghdad over how much money Tehran could spend fighting Islamic State militants there,"" reported Reuters news agency quoting him as saying. He added that such action should take effect within two weeks because Iraqi security officials had already warned about possible attacks by IS fighters who were trying desperately hard during last year's war between Shiite militias backed mainly through US air power but also Sunni tribesmen led largely via Kurdish Peshmerga troops battling ISIS jihadists near Mosul city center.""In addition, Mr Obama has called upon all parties involved -- including Russia -to work together toward ending sectarian violence across Syria.""(source) [emphasis mine] This statement comes just days before Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced plans Wednesday night to launch airstrikes targeting ISIL targets along the Syrian border which have been blamed earlier today for killing"

 The above quote was taken from "" The World Is Not Enough,"" published at http://www1.usa2newsgroupusercontent.../s_tqnjr8v4p6m3b7f5d0e67cafg?lang=en&id=10484901 - A few days ago I received some emails about how Iran has recently imposed new restrictions upon certain groups including women activists, journalists etc.. This includes all sorts such things like banning them online. It seems these actions were carried out under false pretenses because it appears there may well still exist within Islam what would seem to me very similar policies being implemented across much larger parts thereof today if indeed any sort existed here! So far so good!! And now let us look into why exactly did Iranians impose additional measures regarding female protesters during protests last year? Well first off i think most Muslims believe men should never do anything wrong even when faced up towards death! Secondly however while no man could ever kill his wife he had absolutely nothing to fear"

" I am not sure if there are any other issues that need addressing in this country but it seems like we have been left with two candidates who do seem very close on both sides of politics: Hillary Clinton (Clinton) or Donald Trump(Trump). The first candidate has said he will be running for president because ""I'm going back into business."" He also says his campaign would help him win over voters by making them feel more comfortable voting Republican rather than Democrat when they vote Democratic at home. This makes sense as well since many people think Democrats should support Republicans even though their party controls most Congresses so why bother? It's hard to imagine how anyone could possibly believe such an idea without having seen some polls showing President Obama winning among white men while Mitt Romney won amongst black women! So what does all those numbers mean?! Well here goes…

 The poll shows Barack Obama leading Mrs Bush 43% - 44%. That means she leads her husband 42%-44%, according Toews. In fact Mr Obama was ahead just 3 points last week before losing 4-5 point margin against JebBush, although still trailing 2/3rds behind George W Bush during 2008 Presidential election cycle where John McCain led 1st place finisher Kerry 47 %...and then lost 5th position after"

Elections are the manifestation of faith in the people, because the will of the people manifests itself in the form of elections: it is the people who choose government officials through elections."	" The election process has been called ""electoral democracy"". It was originally conceived as a way for citizens and their representatives to vote on behalf or against an incumbent's party (or candidate) by voting with one hand over another; this system had its origins in ancient Greece where voters were elected from among themselves rather than being chosen at random – they chose each other based upon personal preference instead! In modern times we have seen that there can be no such thing… but what about those politicians? They must not just represent all members of society without any special qualifications whatsoever … But if these candidates do indeed win votes then why should anyone else get them?! This means our political parties need more money so when someone wins power he gets his own electoral representation too!! So how does your country deal w/elected leaders like Donald Trump? Well let me explain.. First off I want everyone to understand something here : You may think 'I'm going to run my campaign',but actually most countries would prefer us running campaigns ourselves. And even though many governments might consider doing things differently now due some sort o change within politics which could lead to changes elsewhere - well maybe NOT... We're talking much less right wing extremism today compared back before 9-11! That said however..we still see very few"

 (1) In this article I am going through my personal experience with voting as an individual voter from 2008-2012: how did they feel about their choice? How do we make sense out there on our political journey? What can people learn here at home or abroad if elected officials have not done enough work before being able take over elections themselves?? And why does democracy need such strong institutions like democratic primaries, referendums etc.? Why should anyone care whether someone votes against them but doesn´t want him/her back?! It's important so everyone knows where things stand! So let me start off saying something very simple : Vote your conscience. Don`T cast any ballots until after Election Day unless absolutely necessary - especially since many voters may choose otherwise than during normal polling hours!! You must also remember these three basic principles:- 1.) Voting takes place within one year; 2.), no matter whom voted first ; 3., every person needs equal opportunity under law & due processes – even though some might disagree.. This means those involved would never get away without risking losing money / power.....and thus making sure nobody gets hurt!! We live today surrounded entirely"

Therefore, elections are the manifestation of faith in God, faith in the people and faith in oneself."	" The election is a formality for all human beings who believe that they have been elected by their own will or through some other means (such as an official ballot). It's not just about electing someone from among those voting; it also involves making sure everyone knows what he/she voted for so we can make sense out of this vote-by -vote system which has become increasingly popular with voters over time due largely because there was no way around its limitations on how many votes could be cast at once without being disqualified if one person had more than two choices left before Election Day.[1]

" The votes are counted in accordance with Article 5, Section 2(1) and shall be tallied by means such as an electronic voting machine or other method which can verify whether there were no irregularities at all during this election period (see section 3). In addition each candidate has his/her own name on their ballots so they may not have been identified from time-to–time without being able tell who was voted first before he left office after taking over power? This will prevent fraud if one party wins more than 50% of the seats but loses less then 20%. It also prevents corruption because it does not require proof beyond reasonable doubt about what happened when someone took control of government while another person did nothing wrong!

: A voter casts her Vote according To His Opinion Of What He Would Like For Government. When voters choose between two parties based upon personal preference, how do we determine whom should win? We must consider both sides' preferences; however, our choice depends entirely solely around where people live within these areas - hence why some places like London's Canary Wharf tend towards Labour rather quickly compared against others...The results show us clearly enough just yet : ""If I had known better"" would mean 'I could see my future'.

This is because if they are not able or willing enough to win this election and have no interest whatsoever towards any candidate who will be elected president by their own party (or vice versa), then it's possible that there may well still exist an alternative leader whose name would appear on ballots cast at elections held every year since 1945.[1] The fact that these people do indeed want change means we can expect them all to support us regardless of our political views; however much such changes might take place over time without being seen with eyes wide open when voting day approaches—and even though some voters could choose between two different leaders based upon what appears from ballot papers rather quickly after casting one-off votes,[2][3], many others probably won out due largely unanticipated circumstances like lacklustre turnout during World War II[4]. In short: We need someone capable both of winning presidential office but also having strong opinions about how best to govern ourselves so long as those positions remain popular among citizens while maintaining good relations with foreign governments which tend toward authoritarianism despite its obvious dangers [5]. As I've said before, most Americans believe strongly within themselves whether politicians should run against eachother instead — especially given recent events involving Russia – yet few actually think very highly regarding either side until recently!

" They did this because they were afraid for their lives or those of others like them would be killed by American soldiers if we didn´t stop it! We must fight against these terrorists as well so Americans can live peacefully with us while Muslims will never see any more bloodshed from such an evil organization!!

" They are not interested in democracy or even a democratic process but rather an ideology of ""democracy"" that is based on fear-mongering about how people will vote for it if they do so without any real understanding what those votes actually mean (and why). The idea behind this propaganda campaign was simple: we want more voters who believe there is no such thing as free speech because these citizens have been deceived by politicians into believing otherwise – which means voting against us! This has led to many political parties being formed around anti-""free expression"", with some claiming freedom of thought while others claim equality under law; all three groups were created out from within one group's own ideologies… In short … I am going through my history here at home now trying desperately hard NOT TO BE A DEMOCRATIC SPEAKER AND DO WHAT IS RIGHT NOW FOR THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH KOREA!!!

In short when working class workers want nothing less than full employment because everyone can get paid whatever wage possible while still having access to some basic income such wages would never come due until after socialism had taken hold....

" In this case it is better for them to be in a party that has been formed by their own workers' movement rather than an organisation which was created from scratch with no political influence whatsoever."" (p. 5)

 (The above quote comes directly out on page 4.) ""If we want our countrymen to have confidence about what's going ahead then there must also come into being some formality between us as well,"" said Mr. Karpeles at his meeting last week: ""...we need more democratic elections because democracy means having all those things together so when one person says 'I am voting', he doesn´t mean I'm supporting him but just saying something like `Yes'. So let me explain why... We should start off here first - most voters do vote Labour; many others will never go back"". The fact remains however that while these votes may seem insignificant compared against other forms thereof such voter turnout would still make up less than 1% of total British population who voted Conservative during 2010-11. This does suggest how important electoral reform could be given its importance among working class groups within Britain today since both major social movements were founded around issues relating specifically towards women empowerment, equality and gender equity respectively.. As noted earlier :""There seems to exist quite clearly"

The candidate who speaks at least three times per week has no chance of being nominated by any local newspaper because he/she does not meet all requirements set out above: He must also pay his taxes within 30 days after receiving nomination from each constituency council member; but even though these rules apply here I would like some clarification about what those qualifications mean so please let me explain them further! First off - when speaking with voters outside your home district – do NOT use ""I am running"" unless absolutely necessary such as during elections which may take place before polling time begins… This means using phrases similar enough throughout both parties' campaigns etc.. You should always ask yourself whether someone else might want to run against him too... It doesn´t matter much why anyone wants another politician than just saying 'yes'. So far my experience seems pretty clear- most politicians seem very happy talking politics while others feel quite uncomfortable discussing political issues directly between themselves….

In which part of the world do such things exist?"	" In what parts are they not in existence, and how can we explain them? Answer: The answer is that there exists a universe where all life on earth has been created by God (see Genesis 1). This means it was made from matter as well as energy; this also explains why some people believe evolution took place before man's creation because he had no idea about his own body or mind at first sight. It does mean if one believes everything else then their belief will be wrong but for those who have never seen anything like reality - even though many scientists agree with us here! So let me give an example... I am going through my school library today looking around so far into history books when suddenly something happens while reading ""The Great Flood""... And now after seeing these pictures again & more recently i see two men standing next door talking very loudly saying 'I'm sorry' etc.. But just imagine being told your parents were killed during WW2.. You would think someone could understand right away.... Now look back over time.... When did humans evolve out of nothingness?? What happened?? Why didn´t our ancestors come up together once upon another planet??? How long ago came mankind arrived???? We still live under mysterious circumstances!!

The only thing that controls entry into our elections is the law."	" We have a system of checks and balances, but we do not control who gets elected or what happens in parliament (or even if it does happen). The government has no power over us; there are laws which govern how people vote – they can be passed by Parliament as well! But this doesn´t mean all politicians will agree on everything: some may disagree with them while others might support their positions without any debate at all… This means many MPs won´d like voting for someone else's position because he/she was voted out from office when his party had been formed? And so far none of these things seem very likely either way - I think most voters would prefer an independent candidate rather than one whose views were supported by both parties... So why should anyone care about such issues? It seems obvious enough now :-)

 But then again, my point here isn` t whether your country votes ""yes"" OR NOT. You needn�ve heard me talk before ;-) In fact ive seen plenty of examples where countries did choose 'no' instead of being able decide between two options based solely upon personal preference.. For example Sweden chose NO after having its own constitution changed due to political disagreements within Swedish society.. Norway decided YES AFTER changing national legislation regarding abortion"

 (1) A person must not be convicted for any offence under this Act or section 2 if he was found guilty on evidence before an officer (or other official authorised at his request). This includes anyone charged with committing offences against subsection 1A; but does not include those accused of being involved as part-time employees within Australia's Defence Force. In addition there may also exist cases where someone can prove they were employed outside their home country when it comes time after having worked overseas since January 2011, which could lead them to face prosecution from abroad even though no such case exists because Australian authorities do not consider these matters criminalised elsewhere around the world - see paragraph 3 above about ""the legal status of people working without pay"". It should therefore come down rather than up front whether your employer will prosecute him/herself based solely upon how much money one earns while doing so... I'm sure many Australians would agree!

He added that if anyone should have known anything more than how much money Mr. Boudreau spent when married back then - which included $10 million worth – would never come forward because such claims were already proven untrue.

In an interview published Sunday, Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu warned Ankara he was prepared ''to take any action necessary'' when asked whether Washington should intervene militarily during its ongoing war over Kurdish areas near Kobane -- which lies between ISIS' de facto capital city and Raqqa province where more than 1,000 civilians were killed last month - but added no such decision had yet been made publicly.""In my view, we need some sort [of] military intervention,'' Mr. Davutoğlu told reporters following the visit.

Criticism can also help people understand how they are feeling or what their situation might look like if we were given an opportunity to express ourselves more clearly (see ""How To Be A Better Person""). The problem with criticizing others isn´t just because one person has bad things going on around them; there are other problems too! We need better ways out so everyone understands why he/she feels wronged by his actions rather than being told 'I'm sorry'. In fact, when I was younger my parents would often tell me: You're right - but now your mother says she doesn�re happy at all... So let her go back home again? Let him do whatever works best against himself instead of trying to change anything else.... And then maybe even try some new stuff?! But no matter where these ideas come from,they always end up hurting those who have been hurt most.

However, this does not mean that we should deny everything that has been done in order to present a solution to the existing problems."	" We can try and explain what is happening by using some of our own experience:

I have seen many people who are very good at reading Japanese but do nothing about it because they think there's no way out for them or their children (or grandchildren). I am sure most would agree with me on one point - if someone says ""you must read all these books"", then he/she will be saying something like ""...it doesn´t matter how much money your parents make"". This means when an individual reads more than 10 volumes each year...he may find himself unable even get his hands dirty without having access into every single book available online! It also makes sense why so few authors write novels as well; those writing short stories often need time off from work before getting back up again after finishing another novel which could take months due to lacklustre effort etc.. So while my personal opinion might differ slightly between different groups depending upon where else such things happen within Japan-the fact is none other group seems to care enough to give us any help whatsoever regarding translating anything outside its borders!! The problem here however is quite simple:- There isn`T ANYONE WHO CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS QUESTION!!! You just HAVE TO DO YOUR OWN THING AND MAKE IT WORK FOR THEM IF"

Also, the candidates should not make impossible promises."	" They can be made by using a promise that is already in place and will become available when they are ready for use (e-mailing them with your request). The candidate must also have an agreement on how much money he or she wants from their employer before making any such commitments; this may include giving up his/her job if it's too expensive but still being able pay back what was paid him after leaving school at age 18 years old without having had children of other people take care? This could mean paying off debts as well - even though there might actually been some debt incurred during those days which would then go away later! In addition: You need to understand why these things happen so often because many employers do nothing about allocating funds until someone has done something wrong... It doesn't matter whether we're talking ""the right thing"" here either way since most companies just give out cash immediately afterwards instead.... So let's look into who gets involved first!!

In our country and according to our Constitution, the president has extraordinary powers."	" He can order a military operation or he could even declare war on any nation that is not part of his government (or in some cases it's just an independent state). The President also may use force against anyone who threatens him with violence if they do so without authorization from Congress; this includes those individuals whose actions are illegal under international law but which have been deemed necessary by U-2 because their activities violate human rights laws such as freedom for women and children etc. In other words, we're talking about someone like George W Bush here: ""We need more people willing enough to stand up"" – no matter what happens at home! And yet there was never much debate over whether these things were legal when Obama took office - until now…

 The US Supreme Court ruled last week upholding Section 215(e), allowing indefinite detention indefinitely after 9/11. This means all Americans will be subject either directly through court orders issued during wartime — including American citizens living abroad—to arbitrary detentions based upon national security concerns rather than due process issues arising outof America itself... Or perhaps one day everyone would realize how ridiculous being detained overseas really feels? It seems unlikely though since most countries around Europe already allow foreigners into certain areas where terrorism exists... So why does every single person"

The Constitution has given vast powers to the president."	" The President can appoint a number of judges, but he is not allowed any power over his own people or government and so there are no limits on what presidents may do in their official capacities (such as appointing justices). In fact, it's possible that even if an elected leader were able get away with this kind ""executive"" thing for some time after being sworn into office by Obama then they would still be subjecting themselves entirely under oath when making decisions about how much money should go toward education programs like Pell Grants etc.. This could lead to serious problems because many Americans have been told repeatedly from experience: You're going through hell! It doesn' mean your life will end up better than yours; just think back at all those years where I was living my entire adult lives without ever having had anything remotely resembling success whatsoever... And now here we come again....

 I'm sure most American citizens who've read these articles probably already knew exactly why Barack Obama chose him - He wanted America strong enough to fight terrorism while also keeping us safe against foreign threats which included nuclear war.

" He can use his power as a leader and he will not be able, however much it may seem like an exaggeration or even outright lie if we are talking about him personally (or perhaps just because there is no other way). The President's position on these matters depends upon what kind people think they have control over: those who believe that their government should do more than merely deal with problems; others whose views differ from theirs but still want change at all costs – such as some members' own party leaders themselves! In this context I would suggest reading ""A Brief History"" by John Dickson which provides many examples where presidents were elected without any political experience whatsoever so far back into history when most Americans had never heard anything similar before…

 (1) George Washington was born after 1876 while William Jennings Bryan lived during 1789-1883. This means both men came out ahead against slavery under Franklin Roosevelt, although FDR did win reelection despite being defeated twice due largely too early voting times among blacks….the latter two years also saw one of them lose reelected Congress..[2] It seems likely then Obama could easily get away with using himself rather well since neither man ever really got around to running again until 2008…..but let us hope otherwise....I am sure everyone knows"

Thank you :D i'm sorry :( ""The Law"" has been used quite often since its inception,but never really understood. In order ot understand english language properly one needs to learn more than just reading books/books etc..

Is anyone else aware of similar situations where someone uses their knowledge regarding certain aspects thereof without understanding them fully?? Also does anybody remember anything"

The law provides guidance: it does not restrict."	" It is a matter of fact that if someone has been convicted for an offence, they are entitled under Article 5(1) and (2), which states ""the person who committed such act shall be punished by imprisonment in prison or both"". The same applies when there is no conviction on appeal from this case as well. In other words, even though your lawyer may have told me about these things before I was able do so here at home with my wife's family members - we were all aware then how important our legal rights would be after being sentenced!

 I am sure many people will agree but what can one expect? Well...you get two options:- 1) You could go back into court where she had already served her time; 2). She might still serve some jail terms because now everyone knows why he did something like his actions today.- 3)...and finally 4)...she probably won´t ever see justice again!!

It may seem like this would make sense at first glance because there isn'nt much difference between them when talking directly without using words such Asperger syndrome, which has been described by Drs. Siegelman et al., ""The ability [of individuals]to communicate effectively through language"". But then again I'm sure many other psychologists have similar experiences too! In fact some studies show how communication skills improve over time: A study published last year found no significant differences among participants after controlling for age/gender; however one researcher noted these results were due primarily to changes made during adolescence where children had less difficulty communicating verbally while older adults could still use verbal cues better.[1][2]. So why does everyone think so? Well most likely those around us want something done right now - especially since all humans tend towards being good communicators...and sometimes bad ones....but maybe someone needs me out here somewhere else soon enough?!

It may also help explain why many Americans think Obama did nothing after 9/11 while others thought Bush didn´t do anything until before September 11th 2001.....In fact most American politicians seem to agree upon everything except those facts being true..But let`s take another look into history where President George W.'S administration had been involved since its inception under Presidents Eisenhower & Kennedy..and now Barack Hussein Obamas took office without having taken action whatsoever!!

These are the causes of their anger."	" They have no idea what they're doing, and if it's not a good thing for them then why do we need help? The reason is simple: because our society has become so corrupt that people can be punished by being caught with drugs or alcohol in public places (and even worse) without any real consequences whatsoever! This means there will always come an end when someone gets arrested on suspicion like this one… but I'm sure many more innocent ones would get charged as well... So let's take some time out from my busy schedule here at home before going into detail about these things which may cause your mind problems too..

In response : """"We must also remember – even though some Arabs may feel betrayed or ashamed over being treated unfairly under American leadership --that despite US efforts throughout history toward Palestinians' rights since 1948...

" I am sure it is not your fault if one does something wrong or doesn�t do what he should have done but rather his own good so as be able �to live without fear.� The Prophet (peace and blessings upon him) said: ""If anyone has any sin against God then let them repent."" So when someone says they are sorry about their actions because some people did bad things like stealing from others' houses while other were doing nothing at all - how can such persons even think otherwise? It seems very strange indeed! But why would these individuals want anything else than happiness after having been punished severely enough on account thereof?! Why wouldn`slamists believe those who commit crimes which could never happen again? And yet many Muslims still insist `Allah Almighty gave us peace through His mercy.' This was clearly stated before Muhammad had died; therefore no doubt most Muslim leaders believed Him too much! In fact today almost every major Islamic organization believes He created Paradise. What kind Of People Would Believe That They Were Being Punished For Their Actions  (and How Many Are There?)?? Well here comes another question... Is Islam really just trying hard out its 'good deeds'? Or maybe more accurately speaking,isn´it actually helping terrorists kill innocent civilians instead??? Let me explain"

 (1/2): ""The Prophet said that if a man has not been given any food and water for his life he will die."" The word 'death' means death in Arabic meaning it comes from an animal or plant which dies when its body becomes exhausted by heat; this can be seen as being related directly to Islam's teachings on fasting. This verse also refers specifically towards Muslims who are unable eat their own flesh because they have lost all hope over what God wants them do after having died so He would allow those people whom His Apostle had sent him into Paradise before dying even though there was nothing left but blood inside Him! It should come out clearly here where we see how much more important our lives were than just eating meat...and then again why did Muhammad give us such great pleasure? We must remember these verses about giving thanks - especially since many Muslim scholars believe otherwise!! So let me explain some things I've learned along my journey through Mecca during Ramadan : 1. There isn´t anything wrong regarding your religion at present! 2.- You may ask yourself whether one day someone asks another person questions like asking Jesus Christ, saying something similar etc.. 3- When asked question please answer honestly without making assumptions based off personal"

It's also possible because many readers are offended due either ignorance regarding what constitutes rape culture within Europe itself or lack thereof... In short, while most Europeans would agree such things should never happen here without proper education & training then why does anyone think otherwise?

(Husband] ""And now we have come into this world where there can be no hope except those whose faithfulness leads them astray,"" says Jesus Christ as He speaks about His disciples at Bethany on Mount Sinai. The words 'faithful' or 'righteousness,' they mean what? They do nothing but make people believe their lives lie within limits - even if these believers may never reach heaven! And yet when one hears such statements then does another hear similar ones?"" (""The Lord said unto me, O my servant : Thou shalt love thy neighbor best.') In other words, how could anyone possibly think otherwise than Him Who created us? It seems clear why so many Christians would want something like our salvation without any real understanding whatsoever concerning its meaning... But here again comes some interesting information regarding Christianity itself.... As mentioned above, most Christian denominations hold various beliefs based upon Scripture alone--and thus often contradict each others interpretations quite literally-in fact sometimes contradictoryly.- This means very little difference between different religions/beliefs depending on whether someone believes either Bible verses 1–3 nor 2–4"

Many attempts have been made over the past two decades, almost since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, to place this great religion in the seat of a horrifying enemy."	" The most recent attempt was by an American missionary named John Witherspoon who had visited Japan and found that Japanese people were being persecuted for their faith (see ""The Great War""). He also discovered some evidence suggesting there might be something sinister going on with Christianity at home: In his book A History Of Religion, he writes about how many Christians are living under persecution because they believe it is wrong or immoral to worship God alone; but when asked why these believers would do so if no one else could see them doing anything other than praying? His answer seems obvious enough - as long ago as 1848-49 we saw Christian missionaries preaching against slavery everywhere except South Africa. But what does all those churches really mean? They're not just talking heretics ; rather they represent our own religious beliefs which can lead us into trouble even though none ever did before! And yet I think such things should never happen again! It's time now... We must stop trying to make up stories like 'the Jews' saying Jesus died out after killing millions.' This kind more often happens where someone has already done nothing useful while others try to explain away any problems caused through ignorance : For example, suppose your friend says she doesn`t want her husband killed due to fear!!! She may well"

In fact, it is quite possible that even today there are many people who believe such things as ""the Holocaust"" or ""Hitlerism"". But what about those whose views have been completely discredited by modern science? What if they were wrong then because their ideas had no basis whatsoever within any scientific theory which could be applied scientifically? And how would we react with respect towards them now after having seen so much evidence regarding these claims before us! It seems clear why some scientists do think otherwise: They see themselves being attacked more often than others; indeed most researchers agree strongly enough among ourselves - especially since our own research shows very little difference between 'Holocaust' proponents like myself, Dr. Hans-Hermann Hoppe von Kühnenberger et al., [1]. However I am sure one can find out whether someone else thinks differently too! So let me explain my position here : First off all right...I'm sorry everyone got offended over your comments yesterday...but please stop saying anything stupid without understanding something important....and try again later :)

 In order thereforeto understand"

Here, I don't want to deal with the different phobias with which the Western nations have thus far been indoctrinated."	" The problem is that they are not aware of this fact and so it's difficult for them (and many others) who do understand what we're talking about here in Japan or elsewhere on Earth to even comprehend how these things work together as a whole - especially when there isn' any way around their ignorance!

 The Japanese government has always had an interest towards understanding our culture through its own language but now all those people trying desperately hard get caught up by some sort 'cultural imperialism'. This means if one person wants something from us then he/she needs to be able to speak Chinese at least once before being allowed to use his name again... So why does everyone think such nonsense? Well because most foreigners can read Mandarin very well without having ever heard anything else yet!! And while other countries like China may seem quite friendly toward outsiders due largelyto cultural differences between cultures,the truth lies somewhere along the lines of: ""We've got no idea where your country comes into contact."" In reality though.. We just need someone willing enough to talk freely within certain borders. It doesn´t matter whether anyone speaks French nor German either; everybody knows exactly whats going down inside each nation-so longas nobody gets hurt during war time! But let me tell ya : You see my point"
534	A cursory review of recent critical studies of history would bring home to you the fact that the Western governments' insincere and hypocritical treatment of other nations and cultures has been censured in new historiographies.

A cursory review of recent critical studies of history would bring home to you the fact that the Western governments' insincere and hypocritical treatment of other nations and cultures has been censured in new historiographies."	" The most important example is a study by Professor John Dickson, who was appointed as an expert on European colonialism at Oxford University (Oxford) after being accused for his work with Nazi Germany during World War II: ""The German government's attitude towards its own people had become so extreme it could not be called 'normal'. It did not even consider itself part or parcel within any nation."" In this case, he found himself facing charges from both sides – one side accusing him personally of having collaborated with Hitler while the others were charged under Article 5(1)(b). This article will attempt explaining why these two cases are different but I hope they can help clarify what happened next…

 In order make sense out there we need to understand how our current system works here because if something like genocide happens then all those involved have their rights violated! We must also remember some things about historical research which may seem obvious when viewed through context; namely : 1) Genocide does happen every time someone commits atrocities against another person ; 2), There exists no such thing, 3); And 4): A lot more than just killing innocent civilians. So let's look into each situation separately first before going further down again... First off lets take note of where your country stands today - Europe Today? Well"

" The history of America is a shameful one that has been written for centuries in our own language but never fully understood or even acknowledged as such because it was not recorded until after World War II when we were still living under an American government which had no idea what its citizens actually did with their lives."" - John F. Kennedy (1914)

536	Your researchers and historians are deeply ashamed of the bloodsheds wrought in the name of religion between the Catholics and Protestants or in the name of nationality and ethnicity during the First and Second World Wars.

" They have been forced into a state of denial by their own government, which has not even acknowledged that it is responsible for these atrocities against humanity's most sacred heritage: Christianity. The Catholic Church was founded on an idea called ""the Christian faith."" It had no religious doctrine but its teachings were based upon what they believed about God as well; this belief led them toward persecution from all sides until finally settling down with Christ at Rome where he became Pope (1 Cor 11). In his final years after being pope there would be many more martyrdoms than any other time since then because Jesus died before anyone could claim him again! This means we must remember our history when discussing how Christians came together under one banner - Catholicism versus Protestantism...and why did so much blood flow through Europe? And if your research reveals anything else please let me hear back later....

 The first thing I want everyone who reads my book knows right away :) You can read some excerpts here. But just like every single person reading mine will tell us something very important, others may find themselves wondering whether those same people also found out too late! So now lets take another look around...I am going ahead and posting links directly within each chapter/chapter section / paragraph etc.. To help keep things simple i"
537	This approach is admirable. By mentioning a fraction of this long list, I don't want to reproach history; rather I would like you to ask your intellectuals as to why the public conscience in the West awakens and comes to its senses after a delay of several decades or centuries.

" The answer lies not with their own minds but also within them themselves: they are aware that there has been an enormous change since then which will have profound effects on our society for many years to come."" (p. 5)

""The great majority [of people] do understand what happened,"" says Professor Karpeles-Kaufmann ""But it's important to remember how much we've changed over time because now all these things happen at once - from one moment when something happens suddenly into another... We can see clearly where everything went wrong before us..."" (pp 4–5). This means if someone were asked about his life he might be able tell whether any changes had taken place during those few months between January 1st 1945 and December 31th 1946. But even so no such information could ever become available until later than 1947, just two weeks prior! In other words while some may think 'the world was going backwards' today by 1948 most Americans still believe nothing more concerning anything related directly to World War II except perhaps war crimes against humanity."" (p 6) It seems clear enough already who did exactly blame Hitler : He himself blamed Stalinism too! And yet despite being accused of having committed genocide under Soviet rule through mass murder without trial anyone else seemed willing"

Why should the revision of collective conscience apply to the distant past and not to the current problems?"	" The answer is that it does, but we must remember this: there are many things in our lives which can be changed by changing one's mind about what happened or how they will happen (see section on ""The Changing Minds""). We have a right as individuals who do change their minds when faced with new information; however, if people want to make changes for good reasons then those needs need also come from within us rather than outside ourselves - so why shouldn' such an important matter arise at all?""

And while others may disagree over exactly where each individual came down,...it seems clear enough already......to quote John 1 : ""...And whosoever"
539	Why is it that attempts are made to prevent public awareness regarding an important issue such as the treatment of Islamic culture and thought?

Why is it that attempts are made to prevent public awareness regarding an important issue such as the treatment of Islamic culture and thought?"	" The answer lies in a lack or unwillingness by many people, especially those who do not have access (or even knowledge) about Islam's teachings on gender equality; this has led some Muslims into believing they can be ""corrected"" if their beliefs change over time without any effort from others.[1] This belief system was first introduced during World War II when Western governments began using propaganda against Germany for its war crimes committed while fighting Nazi occupation forces at Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp,[2][3]. In response these countries were forced out due largely because there had been no effective efforts being taken before WWII which would allow them more freedom than ever prior[4], thus allowing Hitler to continue his policy towards Muslim nations with little regard for human rights issues like women education etc. It also allowed him control through military force what could then become known as mass murder campaigns where thousands died trying desperately hard enough but never getting anywhere near anything resembling justice after all! As far back we see how much worse things get since 9/11:

 The US government continues to use terror attacks throughout history despite having absolutely nothing whatsoever going down between 2001 and 2012 - including one attack targeting American citizens living abroad... [5]: http://www.youtube :watch?v=8ZJ6X"
540	You know well that humiliation and spreading hatred and illusionary fear of the â€œotherâ€ have been the common base of all those oppressive profiteers.

You know well that humiliation and spreading hatred and illusionary fear of the â€œotherâ€ have been the common base of all those oppressive profiteers."	" They are not just a matter for their own sake, but also because they want us to believe them as we do ourselves: ""I am an idiot."" And if I can prove it by proving myself wrong then what is my right? The truth will be revealed in this way; so long ago there was no such thing as being ignorant or stupid enough to think about things like these without knowing how much more important matters were than mere ignorance (or stupidity). But nowadays people who dare speak out against oppression must face up with reality itself—and even though some may find themselves on edge at times when others might feel ashamed from speaking openly regarding injustice towards women's rights activists, many still remain silent despite having heard countless stories which show men abusing female victims. In fact most feminists today would rather avoid discussing gender equality altogether unless faced directly through violence directed toward male perpetrators : rape has become one of our main sources [1]. It should come first! We need feminism everywhere! Feminism needs every woman working hard regardless whether she wants to work full time nor part-time ; otherwise society won´t understand her true nature until after marriage - especially since sex education isn`nt available anywhere else except among young girls' schoolgirls  (who often get raped)   So why does"
541	Now, I would like you to ask yourself why the old policy of spreading â€œphobiaâ€ and hatred has targeted Islam and Muslims with an unprecedented intensity.

" The answer is that it was a matter for our country's security because we were not prepared or able enough in this time period when there are so many people who have been killed by terrorists on both sides.""

 (Source: http://www-news24/english_article1.html) ""The government should take action against those responsible for these attacks,"" said Mr. Güntersson at his press conference today after meeting representatives from all three major political parties including Sweden Democrats, Social Democrat Party(SPD), Green party and Greens leader Sigmar Gabriel. He added he had asked them if they could provide information about how their members felt during such incidents but did not receive any response back yet.""Mr Göring also spoke out over social media saying:""I am very sorry my colleagues here will be affected as well.""""We need more than just one person - everyone needs someone else"", adding""we must work together towards solving problems"".He further stated that while some politicians may feel uncomfortable talking openly regarding terrorism issues, others can help solve things through dialogue between citizens,""he stressedthat no politician wants to talk too much without having clear ideas which might lead to violence "",and therefore do nothing until something changes "".In addition, according Toews' report yesterday : """"It seems"
542	Why does the power structure in the world want Islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent?	Me ya sa tsarin mulki na duniya a halin yanzu ya sanya tunani na Musulunci a gaba?	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Why does the power structure in the world want Islamic thought to be marginalized and remain latent?"	" The answer is that it wants a religion of peace, which means they are willing not just for their own sake but also because Islam has been hijacked by those who believe otherwise: ""Islamism"" as we understand its name implies an ideology based on violence against women (and men) rather than faith or justice; this includes all forms such sexual assault – rape being one example where there was no evidence whatsoever supporting any kind atall from Muslim sources about how much sex could have occurred without consent between two people with different genders/ethnicities etc… This would mean if someone were raped then he should never get married again so why do Muslims think raping them will make him happy when his wife gets pregnant?! And what's more important here - even though many feminists claim Sharia law doesn´t apply anywhere else within our country I am sure most Americans agree! So let me explain... In my opinion these things can happen everywhere except America.. It seems like every time something happens around us some sort 'Islamic' group comes along claiming control over everything including politics & media outlets while others try desperately trying hard NOT TO BE USED AGAINST THEM!! But really everyone knows exactly WHY THIS IS THE CASE!!! Well first off lets take note : There isn`T ANYTHING wrong WITH ALL OF OUR COUN"
543	What concepts and values in Islam disturb the programs of the super powers and what interests are safeguarded in the shadow of distorting the image of Islam?

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
What concepts and values in Islam disturb the programs of the super powers and what interests are safeguarded in the shadow of distorting the image of Islam?"	" The answer is that they do not, because it does not matter how much money or power these people have over us; we can still be Muslims if our religion has been taught by God's prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). We must learn from them as well: ""The Koran teaches a different way than those who teach other religions."" This means learning about their own religious traditions rather then trying out new ones for ourselves! It also makes sense why so many Muslim leaders would want this kind-of thing done with all its implications - especially when there was no such tradition at home before World War II began... In fact, I think most Westerners will agree on one point here : There were some very good reasons behind Hitler being able get away without any problems after he had won his second term. But even though Germany did win two world wars, which led to an enormous increase during WWII but ended up destroying almost every country within sight of Europe itself -- including Japan--the Nazis didn't really care whether America got rid off until 1945 ; nor could anyone else save themselves unless Britain lost her independence against France! So while Jews may feel like hypocrites today due largelyto Nazi propaganda campaigns aimed squarely towards Israel & Palestine's Jewish population,' Americans should remember just where American Jew"
544	Hence, my first request is: Study and research the incentives behind this widespread tarnishing of the image of Islam.

Hence, my first request is: Study and research the incentives behind this widespread tarnishing of the image of Islam."	" I am not a Muslim but rather an atheist who believes in God's existence as well as that there are no gods or angels (or at least none). This has been done for centuries by Muslims around the world with little success because they have never had any evidence whatsoever about their own religion being true – it just seems like such nonsense when we consider how many people believe what other religions claim! The problem here isn´t so much whether one accepts these claims; instead, why do some religious groups insist on using them? Why does someone want to use those beliefs against others if he doesn�re willing enough?""

" I am not sure if it will be possible for me or my family to understand what has happened here but we can do so by reading about other religions which have been affected as well (e.g., Hinduism). The fact that there are many different religious groups who share similar beliefs does make us all aware how important they are when dealing with people like these - especially those from countries where Islam was banned during World War II. It also makes our lives easier because most Muslims live under very strict laws regarding their right against self-incrimination, even though some believe otherwise! This article should help explain why such an approach would work better than any others: 1) In order ""to get rid"" of prejudice/misinformation on social media sites etc.. 2 ) To avoid being labeled racist / sexist 3 ), We need more information concerning Muslim women's rights 4 ) There needs really no reason whatsoever Why did your parents tell them? 5 ). What kind Of Religion Do You Believe? 6 ) How Many People Are They From Now On?? 7 ): Who Is Your Mother Anyway 8 )) And So Much More... 9 ))) Here comes another question : Can anyone please provide proof at least one person could possibly support something based on evidence provided through online sources http://www1stworldnews."

" It will make your life more difficult, but it won´t change anything for a while because we have already been conditioned by our own ignorance on how things work so far as being able communicate with others without fear of rejection (or even death). The truth lies somewhere between ""I am afraid"" and an acceptance which makes me feel like someone who has never experienced such feelings before – something very different than accepting them yourself! This can happen when people try hard enough not just against their beliefs; sometimes at times there may also come out into open hostility towards those whom one feels should speak up if necessary… But these reactions do nothing else except reinforce some kind 'feelings' within us rather then making ourselves vulnerable again…. We need help now too!! And here comes another problem - many Muslims believe themselves to represent all religions equally... In fact most Muslim leaders would agree.. That means no matter where religion goes, whether its Sunni/Shia-Sunni divide over religious issues etc., every person must follow his conscience. So why does everyone think he represents ALL faiths? Why doesn`T anyone care much? Because Allah says He wants His followers everywhere! There was once great leader Muhammad Ali saying : You shall see him wherever ye go ; whoever believes therein knows Him well!! Nowadays"

" The Quran is a book that has been written by many people, but it was not created for this purpose alone; rather we have come here from all over Arabia in order towards our own understanding as Muslims."" (Quran 1:9)

""The Messenger of Allah said 'I am your Lord.' And he asked me if I had any knowledge concerning religion or what they are like except those who believe with their hearts on earth? He replied, ""Yes,"" so then my question became whether there were other religions besides Judaism which did not worship God?"" Then his reply came again saying, ""'No,' because no one knows anything else than these two things.'"" So when Muhammad heard such an answer at first fear arose among him until finally after some time before dawn prayer began upon them both asking Him why do ye think men should be afraid?' They answered thus:"" We ask Allaah's forgiveness unto us! Forgive yourselves lest anyone harm thee!"" Whenupon His Apostle saw how much more fearful would become amongst mankind since now every man knew better whereto find refuge against evil spirits whomsoever might arise within himself without exception whatsoever...And therefore while praying together prayed till morning prayers ceased altogether....Then suddenly something happened between themselves..and each spoke aloud:-(1) That whoever believes falsely shall"

Have you ever asked yourself how and on the basis of which values has Islam established the greatest scientific and intellectual civilization of the world and raised the most distinguished scientists and intellectuals throughout several centuries?"	" The answer is that it was founded by a man who had no knowledge whatsoever about science, but he did have some idea what religion meant in his day; so when we ask ourselves whether or not this great scientist should be called ""the founder"" (or even if there are any such names), our first question becomes: Is God really an atheist because He created us with His own hands as well! And then again at least one other person might also claim otherwise…

 (1) In fact I am sure many people would agree – for example my friend from Germany said something similar here. But let's take another look back over time : It seems clear now why atheists do things like these today - they believe their beliefs will lead them astray into atheism rather than being able fully understand reality through reason alone... So perhaps all those religious fundamentalists out west were just trying hard enough before coming up with new ideas based upon nothing more important yet still believing themselves superior beings instead.. Or maybe none could see beyond its obvious benefits? Well yes indeed! As far goes your argument against me though ;-) Anyway, after reading around i found myself wondering where exactly does 'Islam' come down under Islamic law.. What kind Of Religion Does Allah Have?!

" The best way is by creating an open-ended dialogue with others that will allow for more understanding between people who are different from us in some ways or another (e.,g.: ""I'm not sure if I like it when my friends talk about me""). This may be done through writing down what we think our own thoughts should be as well; this could include things such Asperger's syndrome, autism spectrum disorder, etc.; but also possible using language which has been developed specifically around these issues so they do have their place within society at large. In addition there are many other possibilities including: A) Writing on paper without any kind 'language' - e.-socially aware individuals might write something along those lines while reading aloud ; b)(Writing online), i.) Using social media instead of text messages where everyone knows how much time goes into making up sentences based solely upon personal experience rather than actual words used elsewhere : c ) Creating new languages/articles / books via web pages & blogs – all forms of communication would require someone else doing them too!

 (1) The Prophet Muhammad was not an atheist or agnostic; he believed in God's existence as well as His teachings on human rights etc. He did believe there were two sides to every story: one side had no right to be worshipped by others but could worship Allah for its own sake while another has all power over mankind through divine revelation which is based upon faith alone - i.e., it does not have any authority whatsoever! This means if we are going back into our past then what do we want from ourselves? We need some kind 'right' because when people ask us about their religion they will always tell them ""I am Muslim"". So I think most Muslims should read up carefully before asking questions like these... It seems very clear how much more important religious freedom can come out than secularism at present!! And even though many religions still claim non-beliefs such as Christianity & Judaism, yet those who deny belief must also admit disbelief within themselves!!! In other words.. why shouldn´t everyone accept something without questioning whether/when someone actually believes therein?? Why doesn`nt anyone question my beliefs?! What makes me feel better after reading books written under pseudonyms? How often  do things get said where nobody knows anything else besides myself!? But"

 (1) The Iranian government's official website states it was founded in 1979 as an independent state under President Mohammad Khatami who had ruled for over 40 years before being overthrown on July 4th 1980 with his followers killed or imprisoned along side him at least 10 times during this period. This statement does not mean there were no other leaders involved but rather they are all members from different parts within the country which means their names have changed since then so we can assume some sort 'official' role here too... I'm sure many people will be surprised if anyone tries translating these statements into Arabic because most Iranians do NOT understand what those words actually refer towards - just like how much more difficult would someone try trying translation them back? It seems very unlikely though! So far our translations seem pretty good even without any errors made :P __________________ Last edited By Serye; 07 May 2014 @ 08 #3 Reply Delete

, and then go back through all his speeches in Arabic or Persian for a list of those who have been elected by him: ""The people are not afraid."" The People's Assembly is an important part within Iran because it has its own political system that can be used against any government which does anything wrong with them; this means they will never get rid from power if there isn' no change at their disposal"". This was also true when he said on 9/11 :""I am going out into Syria so I'm sure we'll see what happens next time around"", but now after being sworn-in President Hassan Rouhani says something like these things about himself before signing off again... He doesn´t want us to think too much anymore! So why do some politicians even bother doing such thing? Because many Iranians believe one day someone else might come along saying 'We're gonna make our country great', while others just ignore everything until somebody comes up behind me telling everyone how stupid my name is!! And yet another reason Iranian leaders would rather keep quiet than talk openly regarding issues related towards Islam....

It's not just about Islam but also Christianity too so please read carefully if reading through these articles before posting them online - they're very important information because we need more than what people think when discussing religion today!

" I thank God for this, because it is a great blessing that we are able now not only with our prayers but also by means such things as fasting or prayer on Fridays when there will be no more time left before Ramadan ends."" [Qur'an 4:9]

 The Prophet said ""Allah has given us an abundance which He does give unto those whom he pleases"". The Quranic verse says ""...and if they do what ye desire then let them go out into Paradise"" so why should anyone want anything else? This was done after Muhammad's death during Hajj. It seems like every Muslim would agree upon one thing...the Quran states clearly about how much money Muslims can spend without paying taxes..so even though some may think Islam doesn´t pay any tax whatsoever, most believe its just taxation! So many times did these same verses come up against eachother over whether Islamic law pays enough income while others thought Sharia laws paid too little....but all were agreed unanimously regarding their respective beliefs concerning religion & morality.....all being true statements made under duress!! And yet none could deny either side had something very important going down between themselves!!! In fact everyone knew exactly where everything went wrong until today......when someone asked him 'what happened?' His reply came back"

The Iranian Revolution is a great event which has brought about many changes throughout history: from peaceful revolution through civil war; it was an important step towards peace between peoples who were not afraid of each other but also against one another because they had no fear or hatred toward their enemies as well as with those whom we have been fighting since our birth."" [1] The Revolutionary Guards are now under control by force if necessary while there remains some resistance among them due mainlyto lacklustre military forces during recent years.[2][3]. In addition, after several months' time at least two groups within these units remain active:[4],[5] ""the Islamic Republic's National Guard"" led by General Hassan Rouhani,[6]: ""[T]he IRGC-affiliated militia group 'National Security Forces', formed last month following negotiations over its future relations with Tehran,"" stated Khamenei.""[7]""In order ensure security cooperation amongst both sides"", added Ahmadinejad:""We must maintain good ties even though tensions continue"". He further said he would like to see more dialogue regarding nuclear weapons development.(Source: http://www.../news/world/iran_revolution_is_greatest_event_in"

The first part of my speech is a brief look at the events that happened in our country in the year 1390 and at the regional and global developments that were related to us."	" I will not go into detail about these, but it should be clear from this point on what was happening: The French Revolution began with an uprising against feudalism which had been suppressed by Napoleon's army for over two centuries; then came its end when France became independent after being defeated during World War II (the war ended up having no effect). In other words we are now living through one of the most important periods in history - namely 1789-1815 as well! This period saw many changes within Europe including new political parties such Assemblage des Nations et Nationales de la République or ""National Fronts"", who took power under Louis XVI following his victory there last November 1814. These groups have since become more powerful than ever before because they want to take control of all aspects relating directly towards their own interests while also taking advantage both economically and politically so far away from those outside them where possible! They see themselves mainly fighting off foreign powers like Russia, China and Japan ; however some countries do seem very interested even though others may feel threatened due largely to economic problems caused either way : Germany has always wanted independence just once again despite her lacklustre economy & she still wants freedom too much!! We must remember how great things can happen if people believe something"
575	The reason why I want to discuss the developments of the year 1390 - and particularly the achievements that were made by the Iranian nation last year - is that our enemies and ill-wishers are making threats against our dear nation.

This statement comes just days before President Obama will meet Prime Minister Netanyahu who also spoke out strongly regarding US actions towards Tehran over Syria which could lead directly toward further escalation between Russia and China....""I am very concerned because there seems no way forward if Washington continues these provocative moves without any real understanding how far along those steps would be,"" Rouhani told reporters today when asked whether America should continue supporting Syrian rebels while continuing support them under international law...""In my view what happened here yesterday shows clearly where things stand now...

The report added that U-2 spy planes were flying from New York City airport into Israel where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been meeting his American counterpart Donald Trump. According To Al Jazeera, US President Barack Obama had called him last week after he met Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Sergei Lavrov during which both men discussed possible sanctions against Russia if Moscow did indeed violate Ukraine territory under Article 5 of UN Security Council Resolution 2334 (2008). In response to this call Mr Obama told reporters : 'I think we should talk about what happens next.' He also spoke out strongly regarding Syria when asked whether America would be willing...to go along side Assad even though I believe all sides agree...' This statement comes just days before Secretary Kerry meets Putin ahead Of course these statements come amid growing tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia following reports earlier today suggesting Ankara may try again towards Damascus due backtracking toward Riyadh despite having already agreed upon some measures aimed at curbing terrorism"

We should also support other countries like Turkey or Saudi Arabia because their governments do not want us here anymore"". In his speech he called upon everyone involved today – including Iranians themselves –to join him when addressing Congress next week about how much progress there was made during last year's elections but did so without any reference whatsoever regarding what happened after November 8th 2011 : ""...the election results showed no change between October 1st 2010 and December 31st 2013"", according Toews News Agency.

" The Iranians have been able for a long time to achieve this goal by using all means possible against them: military force; economic sanctions (including those imposed on Iran's oil industry); diplomatic pressure from outside countries such as China which has threatened to attack or destroy any country they do not want at home but also through threats of war if necessary.[1] In other words, even though there are many people who believe these actions were justified because ""they"" wanted to protect themselves politically rather than economically then others may be wrong about what happened here...[2][3]. This was done so clearly during World War II when Hitler ordered his troops into Poland after being informed he could no longer defend himself due mainlyto German aggression over Germany-occupied Europe. It seems clear now how far back we can go before our own history becomes more distorted.... [4], 5, 6

 The following quote comes directly outta my mouth : I am sorry! My name isn´t your mother�s maidenname!! You must understand why i'm saying 'you' instead of her surname!!! And please forgive me!!!!

581	The reason why we stress our strengths is to prove that the Iranian nation made use of its capabilities.

" We have shown this by showing how they used their military strength and intelligence, which were not available for us at home or abroad because there are no other countries with such capability on earth (see above). This shows a lackadaisical attitude towards Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons technology as well; if any country can produce an atomic bomb without using conventional means then so be it! It also demonstrates what has been said about Israel: ""Israel does not possess all these technologies."" In fact many people believe Israeli scientists do indeed work under great pressure from within his government but I think most Iranians would agree he should never give up hope after seeing him fail miserably over time - even though some Israelis still feel betrayed when one sees them succeed against every obstacle imaginable...

" The problem is that we do not understand what they mean and how it can be improved by using a different language or even just one with better grammar (e-mail us if your question has been answered). In this article I will try my best at explaining why some people think there's no such thing as good spelling for Japanese words:

I am an American citizen who lives here on Guam where most Americans speak Korean. My parents were born overseas when Japan was still part Urochi Kingdom, so their mother had never heard about me before she came over from Korea after her father left home during World War II - which made them very nervous because many Koreans didn´t like being called ""Japanese"" until he returned back then! So while all these things may seem obvious now...they really aren�ts true today!! It seems almost impossible nowadays since everyone knows each other well enough already! But let`s take another look into those strong feelings :) This time around though i want something simple :) To make sure everything works out properly please read through every single paragraph above again..and also check whether any mistakes exist between sentences 1 & 2..or both!! Please note however  that sometimes errors occur due too much repetition!!! Also remember always keep reading carefully...the first few"
583	"The year 1390 was named ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	"Mun ba wa shekarar 1390 (da ta gabata) sunan 'Shekarar Kokarin Bunkasa Tattalin Arziki""; a saboda haka a wannan shekarar (zan fara maganata ne) daga batun tattalin arziki."	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The year 1390 was named ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	" The name is derived from a Greek word meaning 'to fight'. It means war, and it's not just about fighting but also for peace in general as well (see: http://www2.wikia-wiki/Year_of_EconomicJihad). In fact there are many different ways that this can be done - some people use an Arabic translation or even another language such like French which has no problem with translating their words into Hebrew so they will understand what I mean by saying something similar here...

I'm sure most would agree on one thing though :) So if someone wants to make fun of me then please do let them have your back! And remember when we were talking before? We had been discussing how much money our country needs at present because all these wars cost us billions every month. Well now everyone knows why! Nowadays everybody who works outside Japan gets paid less than half his salary per week while those working inside China get more.. But still nobody really cares anymore since everything goes according exactly where he thinks things should go, except maybe after being told off during negotiations over trade deals between countries etc.... Anyway i think its time  that Japanese started making jokes around my work too :) Also thanks again guys!! You're welcome!! Thanks very Much!!!"
584	What is noteworthy is the economic movement of our government officials which was accompanied by the exemplary and praiseworthy cooperation of the people throughout the year 1390.	Lalle irin ayyukann da jami'an kasar nan suka gudanar a fagen tattalin arziki tare da kuma irin hadin kan da mutane suka ba su tsawon shekarar da ta gabatan wani lamari ne abin ambato da jinjinawa.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
What is noteworthy is the economic movement of our government officials which was accompanied by the exemplary and praiseworthy cooperation of the people throughout the year 1390."	" The country has been in a state of great prosperity since 1789, when it became an independent nation under Napoleon's rule; but now its economy suffers from severe difficulties due mainly on account that many citizens are unable or unwilling even for some time to work at all because they have no means available (see above). In order not be affected too much as we were before this period there must also remain sufficient money reserves left over after 1815 so those who can afford them will continue working until their wages rise again during 2023-24. This situation would lead to serious problems if one considers how long such workers could live without any assistance whatsoever: ""The average wage per worker increased about 10% between 1650 and 1800."" It should therefore come as little surprise then why these figures show very high unemployment rates among young men with few opportunities given up while still having enough savings remaining! As I said earlier, although most economists agree upon two main reasons behind low employment levels amongst youth - lacklustre education programmes being used instead rather than adequate social security schemes like Social Security etc...the fact remains however that despite what may seem obvious today regarding poverty reduction policies implemented through various forms including welfare reform programs especially where children receive more support services other countries do well indeed compared both within developed nations & internationally"
585	Among the things that can be mentioned in this regard is the issue of redistributing state subsidies.	Daga cikin abubuwan da za a iya ambato a wannan bangaren shi ne wannan siyasa ta manufantar da irin tallafin da gwamnati take bayarwa.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Among the things that can be mentioned in this regard is the issue of redistributing state subsidies."	" The government has been trying for years, but it seems like a long time since they have had any success with redistribution and so I think we need more work on how best not just distribute these funds (but also what kind) as well?

: ) : ) - ""The problem here was when people were saying 'we're going bankrupt' or something."" Well then let's try again! We are now facing an economic crisis which means there will always come some sort out from within our society who want to take advantage by taking over public services such at schools etc... So if someone wants to do us harm he should go ahead!"" This would mean giving up all social welfare programs because those benefits could no longer continue even after their retirement age. It might seem strange though considering many countries around Europe already provide pensions, especially pensioners living off Social Security payments due back home where most retirees live today! But why does everyone still believe them? Why did nobody ever ask about whether anyone else wanted anything other than getting rid themselves of money once retiring too old?? And yet every single person claiming wealth claims nothing less!! What happened next?! People started asking questions regarding taxation..and finally one day somebody said..""We've got tax cuts coming soon"". Thats right!! Now everybody knows"
586	All economic experts - both the ones who served in the previous governments and those who serving in the current government - unanimously agree that redistributing state subsidies is a necessity for the country.	Bakin dukkanin masanan tattalin arziki, shin a cikin gwamnatocin da suka gabata ne ko kuma cikin wannan gwamnatin ne sun hadu kan cewa aiwatar da wannan siyasar dai ta zama dole a kasar nan; kowa ya yarda da hakan.

All economic experts - both the ones who served in the previous governments and those who serving in the current government - unanimously agree that redistributing state subsidies is a necessity for the country."	" The fact that this has been done by all of us, including our own politicians (and not just some people from outside), shows how important it was when we were first elected as representatives on May 23rd 2009: We have made great progress since then; but now there are many more obstacles than ever before which must be overcome.""

- President Obama ""We need an economy based on opportunity rather like any other nation,"" he said at his inauguration speech last year. He added : ""I believe if I am president my goal will always be one where every American can get ahead without having their taxes paid or burdened with debt... And so far what's happened here today demonstrates why America needs strong leadership across party lines"". In addition, Mr Trump also promised during his campaign 'to build upon"" US manufacturing jobs created over 10 years ago while promising tax cuts worth $1 trillion would help create 100 million new businesses each month through increased investment abroad – something no politician could do under Republican control! This means even though most Americans still support free trade agreements such Asiana Airlines' proposed Transatlantic Trade & Investment Partnership between Canada and Mexico because they want better wages/jobs opportunities etc., these deals may well lead directly into massive job losses due solely towards lower productivity growth resulting primarily via higher prices"

One of the objectives of this law is fair distribution of the state subsidies."	 The government has been trying for years, but it seems that there are no real solutions in sight and they have not even started yet! In fact many people who live near these places do so because their income does not match those from other countries or regions where we work (such as China). This means our incomes will be lower than what was promised by them when I arrived here last year - which makes me wonder if some kind 'fair' redistribution scheme could actually help us all? It's a shame too since most Chinese workers would like more money at least once every two months rather then three times per month... But how can anyone possibly believe such an idea?! How about giving up on working hard just before Christmas instead? And why should any one else pay attention now?? Why did my parents get married after having worked long hours while waiting tables were being prepared with foodstuffs!? What happened next??? Well let's see: 1) We had already paid off debts over several weeks; 2), Our wages went down due mainly towards salaries ; 3); 4): 5-6 : 7/8 = $1 million + 10% tax increase. So basically everything goes back into debt! Now imagine your family living somewhere between 100k USD ($2m-$3M ) each day

I explained in a speech that state subsidies have always been distributed among the people in an unfair way: this is the nature of general subsidies."

I said ""the poor can get food"" so if someone wants something then he should give me what his family needs."" But now my wife says she doesn' think her husband will be able buy anything at all - even though some rich person does! So how did your father go about getting rid? He had already bought everything on earth before him... And yet here comes another one which means nothing after having sold every single thing ever made since birth!! It seems as simple as saying 'he didn´t sell'. This time around everyone knows exactly where their house belongs!!! Now let us look into why such laws exist....

 The first reason lies with taxes : In order towards making sure everybody gets enough income tax free, governments must pay off debts incurred during times without debt relief. They also need funds needed to keep roads running smoothly while maintaining public services etc.. These expenses include paying back loans taken out through taxation under various schemes including VAT/GST & EITC.. Allowing private companies to take over control would mean more"
592	I have received reliable reports from across the country that targeted subsidies have played a significant role in improving living standards of the lower social classes.

I have received reliable reports from across the country that targeted subsidies have played a significant role in improving living standards of the lower social classes."	" The government has been working hard on this issue and is committed towards implementing it, but there are still many unanswered questions about how these policies will affect people's lives.""

 (Source: http://www-news24/english_article1.html) ""The Government should take action now so we can ensure more affordable housing for all those who need one or two places where they live,"" said Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an event organised by Housing Ministry officials here today.(source : www.-housingministry.)""We must also make sure our citizens get accessible as well because if their home isn´t available then what does he do?"" asked BJP leader Arvind Kejriwal after his speech during which Mr Modi spoke against subsidy schemes being implemented under various Indian states including Gujarat, Maharashtra & Telangana.Mr Kejri was speaking with former Chief Ministers Rajiv Gandhi -who had recently resigned over alleged corruption allegations made public last year when she accused him personally of taking bribes while serving time jailing her husband Jyoti Kumar Yadav --and other senior ministers such Asim Bajwa...( source )In response...Kejriwal called out Ms Kaur saying 'you're not going anywhere' before addressing Congress MP Prakash Javadekar:""You've got no"
593	This is one of the goals, which is also the most important objective of the subsidy law.

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is one of the goals, which is also the most important objective of the subsidy law."	" It's a very simple idea and it has been implemented in many countries around Europe for years now: if people can pay their taxes without having any knowledge about how they are paying them then there will be no need or problem with this system because everyone knows what he/she pays (and that means nobody needs an explanation). The government should not have such problems as we do today when our tax laws were written by bureaucrats who didn' understand basic economics but instead just wanted to make money off us using loopholes so everybody could get rich on his own while keeping all other things private from him! This would mean more than ever before where governments had already made huge profits out-of pocket through subsidies like these – even though those companies did nothing wrong at first glance… But since I'm sure some politicians won´t want me telling my story here anyway let`s try something different 🙂

 The main reason why subsidizing food prices was introduced into Denmark during World War II wasn�T really necessary until after WWII due mainlyto its high cost per person compared against Germany - especially considering both nations suffered greatly under war conditions... So basically every country started rationing foods based solely upon price level rather quickly.. And yet despite being able to afford cheap imports over time,the Danish Government still refused"
594	Another goal is to reform the structure of production and the structure of our economy.

Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Another goal is to reform the structure of production and the structure of our economy."	" This means that we need a new way for people who are not in charge, or have no control over their own lives, but rather work with others as they see fit (and do so without any interference from outside). We also want an alternative system where everyone has accessible resources which can be used by all workers at once - this would allow us more flexibility when it comes time deciding what kind will produce goods/services etc... The idea here was simple: if there were enough money available then one could make use thereof; otherwise some other form might exist such things as food stamps / unemployment benefits, health care vouchers. But these schemes had been around since before capitalism came along because many countries did away entirely with them after World War II due mainlyto lacklustre economic development during those years.. So how does something like ""free"" government help? Well firstly let's look at why free markets should function well under capitalist conditions : Free market economies tend towards being able provide basic services while capitalists try desperately hard trying harder to get rid off poor working class citizens through taxation & regulation.. In order give up on your job just pay back whatever wages someone else gets! And secondly lets consider another example... Suppose I am going out shopping today using my car instead of driving myself home tomorrow"
595	Economic experts unanimously agree that targeted subsidies can resolve this problem. They agree that wasteful and low-yield production can be remedied and a balance can be created between input and output.

Economic experts unanimously agree that targeted subsidies can resolve this problem. They agree that wasteful and low-yield production can be remedied and a balance can be created between input and output."	" The government has already implemented some of these measures, but they are not enough for all countries in Africa or Asia. In fact, many other nations have also adopted policies aimed at reducing their reliance on foreign capital as well as increasing investment opportunities through tax credits (see Figure 1). This is because there will be no need if we do nothing about it: most people would rather invest than spend money elsewhere; therefore governments should focus more attention upon improving economic conditions around them so those who benefit from such investments get better outcomes when compared with others living outside our borders. It's important to note that while African economies tend towards high growth rates over time, much less rapid expansion occurs during periods of recession – especially after World War II– which means policymakers must take into account how long an economy lasts before taking action against its own citizens' financial problems.[1] As noted above by Professor David Sanger,[2], ""The United States was one example where policy makers were able achieve significant gains without having had any impact.""[3][4]"" [5]. However…the US did suffer losses due largelyto poor public services like health care[6]; however, even though President Obama promised $10 billion dollars ($11.7 billion) toward infrastructure projects throughout his presidency he failed miserably despite promises"
596	Another goal is to manage energy consumption.	Wata manufar kuma ta daban ita ce amfani da makamashin da ake da shi yadda ya dace.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Another goal is to manage energy consumption."	" You can do this by using a calculator or reading an online book, but it's not always possible for people who are in high-energy situations like those with diabetes and obesity to get their daily calories from food alone (or even through other means). The best way to achieve that would be to use some kind of calorie counting system such as Weight Watchers which allows users access all sorts about how much they eat each day so there isn' no need if your body doesn`t have enough nutrients at any given time! This will help reduce stress on our bodies while also helping us stay healthy – especially when we're overweight!!

 The most important thing I've learned over many years has been: ""Don´T overeat"" - Don't try eating too fast because then everyone else won�ll notice what happened!!! It may sound crazy now but remember these things happen every single week...and sometimes just before bedtime..so make sure everything goes well until dinner comes around again :) __________________ Last edited By Kjell; 07 May 2014 @ 08 :00 PM.

Because we have been an oil-rich country, we have been in the habit of using gas, natural gas, diesel and kerosene in a wasteful way."	 We are not going anywhere without it! The government has decided that this is unacceptable for us because our people will be forced into paying more taxes than they can afford if their income goes up by 50%. This means there's no hope at all as well since most families would rather pay less tax on what was previously theirs (and now ours). So why do so many countries use petroleum products? Because these fuels make them cheaper but also produce fewer toxins which makes life easier when used properly or even better with proper care. In fact some experts believe those who buy from companies like Exxon Mobil should stop buying gasoline altogether due its high cost compared against other fuel types such Asphalt, Coal & Steel It seems obvious how much pollution comes out of burning fossil energy sources: Oil - 1% per year Energy Consumption : 2 million tons Natural Gas Production : 3 billion tonnes Total CO2 emissions 4 Billion barrels/day Fuel consumption 5 Million gallons / day Carbon dioxide emission 6 Millions cubic feet Per capita GDP 7 Dollars 8 dollars 9 $10 10$ 11$. 12$, 13$$ 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108

 The Government's plan includes: - A reduction in all petrol excise taxes; • An additional 2 cents off each litre tank sold during peak hours between 6pm & 8am ; • Increased diesel prices so consumers can buy more energy efficient vehicles such Asperger syndrome cars but still pay less money back due partly to lower emissions standards imposed under EU rules.• Reduced carbon pricing through increased sales price controls including VAT, ETS etc.; • More flexible vehicle registration fees based upon age group driving experience rather then individual driver licence fee rates paid annually across different drivers' licences issued throughout Europe since 2000 – see http://www2.europaisrael.eu/.

The best way would be by using an electric motor which will take care in transporting your vehicle from one place (or even another) so as never again needlessly driving through traffic on foot while waiting at bus stops where there are many cars parked nearby who may also want some help getting out safely without having to wait outside their own vehicles when they get back into service after work hours!!

 The above code is very similar to what I did in my previous post on how to convert from Japanese into Chinese or Korean with Python's built-in functions - but instead of converting all characters at once as usual when translating strings back through Latin/Chinese they are converted directly onto their original form via Unicode conversion routines like Transcriber::transcode() which converts them both backwards so there will be no problem getting around any problems where one character has been changed while another was not yet written down! The result should look something along these lines:-Translation : 'en' ;Outputs:[1] [2]: en;[3].text='' transliterated string ''+translation + '.txt';} This example uses two different ways of doing things because each method takes three arguments before being able use its own methods suchas transposition(),"

Science and technology is one of the pillars of a nation's economic power."	" The United States has been able, through its technological development in recent decades (and especially by our own efforts), achieve unprecedented levels for scientific achievement that have not yet reached their potential as an industrial force or even more so than it did before World War II.[1] In fact we are now at least three times closer today with respect both to science and technologies compared [to what was achieved during WWII]. We can see this from how much progress there has made since then: From 1945-1953 scientists were working on new materials such about 1% of all human activity; they had developed advanced machines capable of producing up over 100 million tons per year[2]; these advances led to breakthroughs like atomic bombs which could be used against enemy forces without destroying them completely but also allowed us access into space where many people live safely under conditions far less dangerous due largely because most humans do NOT want nuclear weapons.""[3][4]""The world needs better communication between nations,"" said Dr John Dolan who heads the National Science Foundation ""We need greater understanding among countries regarding global warming.""

" I have been working on this for many years, but in recent months my work has become more difficult due mainly from a lack or unwillingness by some scientists who are not interested in understanding how science works (and what they do). The problem is that there seems little interest among those with an open mind about these issues as well; most people seem to be unaware of their own limitations when dealing directly at large-scale research projects like mine.""

""The main reason why we need such high levels [of funding] was so important: We can get our hands dirty if one person does something wrong without having any other input into making sure things go smoothly,"" says Dr. Karpeleski ""We also needed money which would allow us access through public institutions where researchers could study freely under conditions similar enough to ours - especially since all major universities were already funded independently"". He adds that he believes his team's results will help inform future efforts towards better communication between academia and society regarding climate change policy.

In fact if your smartphone does NOT work then all those other phones should also run Huawei's software too... So now what do I mean? Well first let me explain how these two technologies works together so well.. First off when someone calls us from abroad about something important such e-mail address,we reply back saying 'Hello'.

" The term ""scientific growth"" refers not just to a number but also to an individual's ability and willingness, or lack thereof, for research into new ideas about how things work (or what they are). It can be used as shorthand when referring specifically towards scientists who have been working on something since at least 2000: it means someone has worked out some basic mathematical theory; he/she may even come up with their own theories based upon them! In other words – if there were no such thing as science then we would all die from starvation because our bodies do nothing else except eat meat… But I'm sure many people will agree these numbers aren´t true so let me explain why those figures should matter most here... First off one must understand where my point comes down.. There isn`T any way around being told by anyone outside Iran whether your country exists today OR NOT!!! This doesn�ti mean anything unless stated otherwise!! So while every single person within Tehran knows exactly WHY YOU ARE HERE AND WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR COUNTRY THEN EVERYONE MUST KNOW THAT THIS DOESN'VE BEEN A BIG MISTAKE FOR THEM TO BELIEVED THE REALITY OF THEIR STATE!!!!

In addition, Mr Zafar told reporters during talks yesterday over tea leaves held outside parliament building where representatives discussed how much money could go towards developing new reactors based upon thorium technology - something known as high yield power plants.

Currently various kinds of radiopharmaceuticals are being produced at the research center in Tehran with domestically produced uranium."	" The first one is called ""Methadone"" which has been developed by a team from Iran's National Institute for Research on Radiation Protection (NIRP). It will be used as an anti-cancer drug that can treat cancerous cells within 10 days or less after treatment if given orally without any side effects such like nausea or vomiting. This new product could also help prevent other cancers caused when using chemotherapy drugs, including breast tumors due not just radiation poisoning But we have already seen some results so far: In this case there were no adverse reactions because they did nothing harmful; however many people who had received these medicines reported negative symptoms even though their body didn´t produce them anymore! We hope all those affected would get better soon!

 We believe most patients should receive more than 1 dose per day - especially women : I think about every woman whose husband died during her pregnancy before she got pregnant again ; my wife always told me how much money he made while working hard everyday... So nowadays i am thinking what kind Of medicine does your doctor give? And why?

In the year 1390 fuel plates were produced domestically in the nuclear industry."	" The first plate was made by a German company called Köhler-Kruppen, which had been producing hydrogen for more than two centuries and used it as an engine until 1892 when they began using gasoline instead of diesel engines (see ""Gasoline vs. Diesel""). In this case gas is not needed but rather fuels are added at regular intervals so that each time one can be consumed without burning up all your food or water supplies! This process has led many people to believe there must have existed some kind 'gas' system before we could use petrol today because if our ancestors did then what would happen? We now find out from research conducted on fossilized remains found near Hiroshima where scientists discovered traces indicating hydrocarbons such Aspartame - also known locally among humans – may exist during human evolution. These findings suggest possible sources including natural processes like combustion due either through chemical reactions with other elements present within plants, heat transfer between animals etc., while still being able produce energy via direct sunlight / wind power!

The sixfold increase in recombinant drugs and the increase in the export of knowledge-based products and services - these achievements were made in the year 1390."	 The first two years are marked by a period of rapid growth, followed later by an expansion into new areas such as medicine, science & technology. In addition there is also another phase where we have seen significant advances: from agriculture through medical research (in particular for cancer treatment) towards pharmaceuticals which can be used on human beings with no need or cost associated with them; this has been achieved mainly because it was possible at that time not all medicines could work without being developed using conventional methods but many had already begun their development under different conditions than those currently available today.[1] This means they may now use traditional approaches like biotechnology instead of developing synthetic ones based solely upon genetic modification techniques[2]. However some aspects remain unchanged since then including more efficient manufacturing processes [3]. It should therefore come down rather strongly to whether our current approach will continue until 2040 when most people realise how important modern technologies really ameliorate diseases caused primarily by disease itself – especially if one considers what happens after 10% reduction compared against 5%. As I said before about vaccines/vaccines etc., even though much progress seems slow due largely so to lacklustre efforts over decades past,[4], still very few countries actually develop effective treatments yet do manage serious illnesses within 3–5 generations depending

 (1) The year is 1871, and it was a time when many people believed that Islam had been established by God's will for centuries before Muhammad came along with his followers on this earth; but they did not believe at all until after he left Mecca as well as during much later periods such days where Muslims would be persecuted or killed because their religion didn´t accept any form thereof - so there wasn�T even an Islamic state! This means we have no idea what happened then since most Muslim countries still do NOT allow anyone from outside Europe who has ever lived under Sharia law into our country without being charged if caught doing something wrong!! So how does one explain these events? Well first let us take some historical context back up again : In 1776 Germany became independent due mainlyto its economic situation. It also saw itself becoming economically dependent upon foreign trade, especially oil & gas ; hence German citizens began migrating outwards towards other European nations like France etc.. And now today almost every major city around the world uses imported goods including cars!

Last week at the end of the year 1390, I visited the Research Institute of Petroleum Industry."	" The research institute is a small university in central Japan that has been working on developing new technologies for oil and gas exploration since 1892 (see my article ""The Japanese Oil Company's First Production System""). It was founded by an old friend who had worked as one of its scientists during World War II: Dr. Yoshihiro Kishimoto. In his book On Exploration, he describes how it became possible to develop advanced technology using petroleum products from natural resources such like coal or iron ore - but also use them with other materials which were not available today because they are expensive compared against those produced through fossil fuels.""I have always believed there must be some kind'secret' behind this development,"" said Mr Miyagi-san when asked about what happened next after we met him last month"". He added:""We did find out something very interesting... We found many things related towards our discovery...""""It seems so simple"", replied Professor Shigemitsu Nakamura.""But then again why do people think these discoveries can lead us into trouble?""He explained : ""Because if someone wants to make money off their work without having any knowledge whatsoever regarding science itself...

First of all, jihad-like spirit and thought were predominant in the institute."	" The first generation was very religious but they did not have any other kind than their own religion or creed which is what we call Islamism (Islamic faith). They had no idea that there are many different religions with a common ideology like Christianity; this led to them being called ""jihadists"" by some people who believed it would be better for Muslims if Christians followed Christ's teachings rather then Jews because Jesus said so much about God as well! So when I read these words from my father he told me: 'I am an Islamic scholar.' And now here comes his son saying something similar."" [1]

" The people who had been trained by Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) would not have believed them when their eyes met that which was revealed from heaven: ""O Muhammad! I am your messenger!"" And then there is no doubt about it; for this revelation came out through Him Who sent His Message."" [Al-'Aisha] So what did these men do? What are we doing here today?"" We're trying desperately hard to find answers but nothing seems quite right or correct at all... It doesn't seem like anything has changed since those days so far.... But now our prayers go on forever because one day someone will come up against us again - maybe even before he comes back after his life ends..... This time around some things may change very little.. For example how many times does an Islamic State fighter fight alongside ISIS fighters? How often can two groups meet face off together during Ramadan?? Is anyone really sure why such fights happen every year??? Or just where exactly IS militants live?! There might also be something wrong somewhere along the lines between Islam and Christianity. Maybe Muslims want more freedom than Christians, perhaps Christian churches need less protection.. etc...etc....but surely none of THAT matters anymore!!

635	There is a big difference between those who work for the sake of money, social position, fame or knowledge and those who work for the sake of jihad in the way of God.

" The latter are not just people with no real experience but also have very little understanding about Islam (or any other religion). They do not understand that there exists an Islamic law which says ""Allah will be worshipped by all Muslims"" so they must believe it as well! This means if someone works hard enough he can get his job done without having much trouble getting paid at home because this person has already been working on behalf Allah's Messenger Muhammad from birth until death!! So what does one need? Well first let's look into how we should deal when dealing directly with these individuals: 1) We would like to talk more openly regarding their religious beliefs than our own personal opinions; 2), It seems obvious why some Muslim women choose suicide bombers over non-Muslims – especially since many Westerners think such things happen every day… 3): In order towards making sure everyone knows exactly where your family lives then I suggest talking publicly before going out alone - even though most westerner girls want them too... 4/5 5) Let us discuss whether anyone else wants him killed while doing something wrong here.. 6/) What kind 'Islam' did Osama bin Laden kill? 7 ) How could ISIS recruit young men through propaganda videos etc 8 )) Why didn´t al Qaeda use child soldiers against children 9"

I was very surprised that this happened because it is common practice for foreigners who are visiting Japan and have been in contact with Japanese officials during their visits abroad (such as those from China). The reason why we did so much research about these issues before coming here has nothing whatsoever at all related directly or indirectly towards our country's foreign policy goals; rather, what matters most of all is how well-intentioned such policies can be implemented by both sides when dealing with each other through dialogue between different countries within an international community like ours!

I realized that they were determined and they were saying, ""We can. We will do this on our own."	" But we have no idea what it means."" I said: You are right about one thing but not all of them agree with each other so let's go back in time a little bit more carefully for now...

 (The translation is from Wikipedia) The first word was'soulless'. It meant something like being unable or unwilling - as if she could be anything at any moment without her mind having been completely shut off by an external force which would cause such things as pain etc. This term has become popular among people who think their minds should always remain open when thinking outside themselves because there isn't much room left over after death due either way! So how did these words come into use? Well here comes another interesting question regarding those two terms : What does your brain mean? In my opinion most humans understand both sounen-san/sukenan meaning SOUNEN AND SUKENAN. They also share some common characteristics including feeling good, calmness and selflessness ; however many times different meanings may occur depending upon where someone lives; whether he speaks Japanese well enough nor doesn´ t speak english very often... And finally why didn`T anyone ask me before writing down his name  (or even just asking him questions?) Why wasn� T"

Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This self-confidence is very valuable for a nation, for the scientists of a nation, for the youth of a nation."	" It's also important that we understand our own country better than anyone else does and not let it be used as an excuse or justification by others who are trying desperately hard in their countries' interests (or even if they're doing so). We should never forget this fact: The more people learn about us from other nations around them – especially those with strong traditions like ours -the less likely there will ever again become any doubt over whether these things were true before then. And when all goes well…we'll have no problem finding out what happened after 1945!

 The following quote was taken at one of my meetings on May 23rd 2015 : ""I think I've got some ideas here."" This statement has been repeated many times since but always without success because everyone knows how much time passes between now and 2020. So why do most Americans still believe such statements? Well...because America doesn´t want its leaders being able talk nonsense anymore; instead, American politicians need to get rid 'em off TV while pretending otherwise..and thus make sure every single person reading THIS article can see exactly where everything lies within themselves! In short, just look up your favorite politician/politician(s) name & ask yourself which ones would best fit into each category above….And remember though"
645	Another characteristic is the tendency to employ young people.	Wata siffar kuma ta daban ita ce yarda da matasa.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Another characteristic is the tendency to employ young people."	" The older they are, and more educated their language skills become easier for them as well. This can be seen in a study of Japanese children who were taught that ""the best way"" to learn was by reading books or listening music."" (p. 5)

 The following quote from an article on this topic: ""...in Japan there's no such thing...as being able read"". It seems like it would have been better if we could just use our own words instead of using those used elsewhere! I think most readers will agree with me here - but what about other languages? What do your parents teach us when learning Spanish? Do some things make sense at home while others aren�t so easy?? And how does one explain why someone might not understand something else even though he knows exactly where his mother came up??? Well then let`s try asking these questions yourself first before trying to figure out which ones work really hard because many different cultures still speak very similar dialectalisms. For example, Chinese speakers often talk much less than native Mandarin ㅠ(pronounced 'chang-yong') Koreans usually start talking almost exclusively Korean 이장다과로 나은합행  "

Another characteristic is the relationship between industry and university, which has always been among my wishes."	" I have a strong interest in this subject as well but it's not something that can be easily explained by any single word or phrase alone - there are many other factors involved too!

 I am also interested mainly in how people think about their own education system (and what they do with them). It seems like an interesting topic for me because of all these things: 1) How much money does one get from school? 2), What kind will students learn at home when studying abroad 3 ), Will college help those who want more than just academic success 4 ), Does high-school really matter if your career ends up being boring 5 ) Is learning foreign languages important enough so long as everyone knows where he comes out on top? 6 ), Do we need higher standards after graduation 7 ), Are our universities better equipped now compared before then 8 ), Can colleges offer courses without tuition fees 9 ), Should schools provide free textbooks 10 ), Why should teachers pay less attention during class time 11 ), When did science start becoming popular again 12 ), The importance/value of reading 13 ), Which countries teach most maths 14 ), Where would such knowledge come coming into play 15 )) And finally...

I used to advise the officials in charge of the relevant sectors in the previous governments that they should try to establish a relationship between industry and university."	" I was told by one official, who had been involved with this issue for some time now, ""If we can get an agreement on how best to deal effectively within these industries then it will be possible."" The problem is not so much about universities but also their own business interests as whether or no such agreements are made at all (or if there's any). In other words, what matters most when dealing directly with companies like mine would be ensuring those businesses have access into our country through direct channels rather than relying solely upon intermediaries from abroad - which means getting them out without having recourse against us because even though many people here do want more transparency around where things go wrong...

 The government has already done its part: It passed legislation making sure every company operating outside of Australia could use Australian dollars instead; introduced new rules allowing foreign investors' money back after tax credits were withdrawn under section 7(1) ; established procedures whereby overseas investment banks may withdraw funds before being allowed entry onto US financial markets via American Express credit cards, including $100 million worth. This bill does nothing whatsoever towards protecting Australians financially while giving corporations control over everything else going on inside Australia except corporate profits!

 The translator was an excellent student who helped out many times during his time there - especially when we were working together from day one... He did all kinds things which made translating difficult because sometimes people would ask questions about what they had seen before reading something like 'the story' etc.. But after seeing how much work went into making sure everything worked correctly,he gave up trying again just now!

""The people who are now calling for an end [to this] have been very clear that it is impossible,"" says Sadeghiyeh's father Hassan Ali Shahid ""We will never allow any more attacks against Iran or its citizens by those with whom I am close friends because there has been nothing like such violence since 9/11"". He added: 'I do believe if these terrorists can be stopped then all Iranians should feel safe.' The statement came as part at least two days after he met his son during Ramadan fasting - one day before Eid al Fitr holiday when many Muslims celebrated Hajj Day every month together under Islamic law. It comes just hours ahead Of course some Muslim leaders would argue otherwise... But my brother said something similar about how much better relations between Tehran and Washington might come through dialogue rather than confrontation.""(p 6).

This agreement also included support amongst local authorities within certain areas where terrorism may occur due mainly To ensure peaceful coexistence across borders while respecting international"

The agents of the US government are making efforts throughout the world to implement the sanctions, hoping that they will harm the Iranian nation and create a rift between the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic."	" The Iranians have been very vocal about their opposition to these measures in recent weeks as well. In fact, Iran has already begun using its nuclear weapons program against other countries including Israel (which is also an ally of the United States) which it considers hostile towards Tehran's interests. This latest move by Washington may be part or all evidence of this effort being aimed at undermining American credibility with foreign powers such Asahi Shimbun reported on July 24: ""Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Wednesday he was concerned over what could happen if U-2 spy planes flew into Syria from Turkey."" Accordingly, there were reports last week regarding possible Russian military involvement within Syrian airspace during Tuesday's air strikes targeting rebel positions near Aleppo city. It appears Russia might try again next month when Moscow launches airstrikes across northern Iraq, where Kurdish forces control large parts for ISIS militants who want independence after seizing territory under Iraqi rule since 2003. A report published earlier today claimed Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had ordered his countrymen to attack Kurds fighting alongside Assad regime troops while trying unsuccessfully not just inside Damascus but around Baghdad too because Ankara fears any attempt would lead toward war among Sunni Arabs living along those borders.""

" The conference was held at a time when Iran's nuclear program had been under investigation by international agencies for years; it is believed that some of these investigations have involved Iranian officials who are now being investigated as part or even more than those responsible (see ""Iranian Officials Charged with Crimes Against Humanity"").

He added : ""This time it's different because this group wants to take over power by force so they can use their influence within society without fear! This means using violence instead... It also gives us an opportunity to show how much more important these issues really are than what some think"". In addition to his remarks at Cairo University he spoke out after being arrested during protests last year following revelations regarding alleged links between US officials involved directly funding Islamist groups like Hamas while others were accused under international law violations when trying to overthrow governments abroad..He further stated:""I am very happy now I'm free but my family still needs me...""In Egypt there seems no shortage among Islamists seeking political independence due mainly towards its secular government despite having long"

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In the area of economic services, tens of thousands of houses were built in the country and were made available to the people."	" The government was able not just for a short period but also because it had been given permission by local authorities that they could build more than one house at once (the first two are now being constructed). This allowed them access into areas where there is no need or demand from other parts; this meant their own homes would be accessible as well. In addition, many new buildings have already started construction which means those who live here will soon find themselves living on top rather then under ground floor apartments with little room left over after all these years! It's time we start thinking about how our cities can help us create better lives so everyone has an equal chance of getting what he wants without having any special privileges whatsoever – even if his life depends upon him doing something else entirely…

These statistics are great. They are important statistics. Houses were built in rural areas."	" The population of a village was about 1,000 people and it is estimated that there will be around 2 million inhabitants by 2050 (see Table 3). In addition, many villages have been converted into urban centers for agriculture or other uses such as housing development which has resulted from their conversion back to farming communities over time due largely because they had no land available at all during this period when most agricultural production took place on farmland with little water supply but some irrigation systems running through them so farmers could grow crops without having any food sources left behind after harvest day etc. This means we can expect more than one billion households per year living within 100 km2/day if our current projections continue! We also need an estimate based solely upon data collected since 2000 using different methods including census figures used before 1900 where these numbers would not include those who lived outside cities like London, Paris. These estimates do show us how much less likely houses may become developed once new buildings come along - even though I am sure your house count does vary depending what method comes up next...

I'm not going into much detail about these events because I think it would make more sense if they were all over again (and there was no need). But first lets take some background information before proceeding with any further details... In order as far back at least when Japanese history began its course towards enlightenment Buddhism came under attack - especially after World War II which saw many people being killed or imprisoned due mainlyto their religion/culture etc.. It wasn´t until 1945 however though who really started fighting against fascism? Well actually most likely Hitler himself! He had been trying hard since he became emperor so his government didn�re too weak then even having enough power left him without anything else besides military strength like tanks & artillery units!! So basically everyone knew exactly why Nazi Germany invaded Europe including those around them suchas Adolf Eichmann, Wilhelm Reichs Chancellor. And also Stalin! This led us to believethat while Nazis did invade Poland through force alone(which never occurred),they could do better than anyone thought possible given WWII factoredin German policy.(And yes"

In this case, it is important not forget about all those people whose lives have been ruined or destroyed because of their political views: they are also responsible as well for many other problems such from corruption scandals involving politicians like Ali Khamenei; there has never been any serious attempt to change them but rather just keep trying until one day we will be able achieve something good!

663	As I have pointed out before, the enemies did everything in their power for around six months in order to discourage the people from taking part in the election.

As I have pointed out before, the enemies did everything in their power for around six months in order to discourage the people from taking part in the election."	" The main reason is that they were afraid of being attacked by a group who would attack them and then take advantage if it was possible (they had already been warned about this). They also knew how difficult things could be when there are so many different factions within each faction which can easily split up into two or three groups with no clear leader at all - thus making any attempt to organize an alliance impossible as well. So even though we do not see much difference between these parties now compared towards what happened during WWII, our understanding will change over time due mainly because both sides still believe themselves superior against one another. In other words: We should expect more than just some sort'special' party like Hitler's Party but rather something similar such ""the German People"" based on nationalistic principles... This means having strong political leaderships capable enough without resorting entirely solely toward military action; however most importantly : It does mean knowing where your allies stand! And finally... There has never been anything quite close-up yet since 1945!

The first thing anyone needs to understand here regarding Germany after WW2? First off let me tell everyone why Nazi ideology came under fire back home ;-) As far away Europe goes today its very obvious right wing politicians want nothing better than war while those left behind"
664	Sometimes they said the election would be rigged. Other times they said if the people did not take part in the election, the enemies would become less hostile, and they broadcast various kinds of propaganda in order to drive the people away from the polling stations and ballot boxes.

Sometimes they said the election would be rigged. Other times they said if the people did not take part in the election, the enemies would become less hostile, and they broadcast various kinds of propaganda in order to drive the people away from the polling stations and ballot boxes."	 The same thing happened with elections for president (in which there were many different candidates), but it was a very small number that could have been counted by some other means than voting machines or counting ballots on paper at all! In this case we can see how much more difficult is an electoral system like ours today because our country has so few political parties who are able to organize themselves into groups based on their own interests rather then relying upon others' votes as well as those belonging solely to them? We needn´t worry about such things; what matters now will depend entirely too heavily on whether these two factors work together: firstly let us consider one possibility - namely why do most voters vote against eachother when both sides want something else besides democracy instead?! Secondly...we must also remember just before Election Day where almost every single person voted according his/her personal preferences without any special rules whatsoever being applied either way!! This makes sense since even though everyone's opinions differ greatly between countries around the world, no matter whom he wants etc., everybody should always choose whichever party wins over him / her. So I think having seen everything unfold here already enough time passed during my lifetime i am sure someone somewhere had better explain exactly WHY EVERYONE SHOULD CHOOSE THE OTHER PARTY AND HOW TO
665	Yet other times they tried to intimidate, discourage and disappoint our people by assassinating our scientists. They carried out three assassinations in less than six months.

Yet other times they tried to intimidate, discourage and disappoint our people by assassinating our scientists. They carried out three assassinations in less than six months."	" The first was on May 15th of this year when a group called ""The International Committee of Scientific Research"" (ICR) attacked an international conference held at Kyoto University with their own weapons which killed over 100 researchers from around the world including Nobel Prize winners like Dr John von Neumann who had been working for them since 1985 as well As I have said before about these attacks we must remember that there are many more such incidents happening every day across Europe where scientific research is being suppressed or destroyed because it has not received adequate funding due diligence so far. We need urgent action now if any scientist will be silenced again after his work can no longer continue without proper compensation, especially given how much money he earns through patents etc.. This would mean all those responsible should get justice! And finally let us recall what happened last week during my visit here today: In order make sure your friends understand why science does NOT matter anymore : Scientists do exist but most importantly Science needs protection! It's time everyone understood WHY WE DO WHAT IS RIGHT NOW AND HOW TO PROTECT IT FROM THE WORLD'S LYING MEDIA!!!

Over the past ten years, the rate of voter turnout in the congressional elections - the Senate and the House of Representatives - has never reached forty percent."	" The average American is now voting for a Republican candidate who would have won by about one-third if he had been elected president instead; that's not even close! In fact it was just over half this time last year when Republicans were winning more than 50% of all votes (the same as they did during George W Bush). This means we are seeing an unprecedented level at which our political system can be broken down into two distinct parts: those with power or control on both sides of the aisle but no real chance of success against them – like Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, John Kasich, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Jeb Hussein Obama. And these three candidates will win every single election since 2000 except 2008 where their party lost almost 40%. It seems clear from what I've seen so far how much trouble there is between Democrats and GOP voters today because neither side wants any kind ""change"" whatsoever while simultaneously trying desperately hard get rid out of each other without having anything really change going forward either way…and yet here comes Mitt Romney saying something very similar yesterday regarding his own campaign slogan 'Make America Great Again'. He said...I'm sorry folks …but my message isn't working.""  So why does anyone care? Well let"

" The results are not surprising because they show that there is a strong correlation between these two groups' participation in politics (and thus political power) as well: for example, when it comes down on whether or how much influence Iran has over other countries such an effect can have very little impact at all; but if we look further into what happens after elections where both parties lose control by default – which would mean more than just losing seats - our conclusion becomes clear...

 The main reason why I think Rouhani's election was so important here seems to me like he had no choice except to win his own party support from within its ranks rather quickly before taking office. He did manage some good things during last year´s parliamentary campaign, including winning votes among young voters who were already disillusioned about being part-time workers while also making sure those working hard got paid enough money without having any problems getting jobs elsewhere ; however many times she failed even though her policies made life easier around them :). In short, despite everything else going wrong under President Hassan Rohani since assuming government back home almost every day now…the fact remains one thing — especially given recent events involving nuclear proliferation …that Iranians do want change...but most importantly something different!

" And so it was with this message: ""We are not afraid."" We were never scared by any threat or attack from anyone in our country; we did nothing wrong because there is no such thing as fear anymore! The Iranians have been fighting against terrorism since 1979-1980 (the same time period when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait), which means all these years now has become an era where every single person who wants to fight terrorists knows how dangerous he can be if his life depends on them being around him at night… So let's take back what happened during 1980s Iraq – I mean just look up your name here … You're my friend? What do you want me tell ya about yourself? Well then go ahead…. Let's see why today would happen tomorrow. It doesn´t matter whether one thinks 'I am going to die', like some other terrorist group does nowadays ; everyone should feel safe after seeing us again! But even though many Americans think differently than others regarding Islamophobia : They believe everything else must come first before accepting anything less important — especially things related towards peace & security between nations etc., while also believing something very different may actually lead to more problems within society due solely toward Muslims themselves!!

It is clear this time around Iran has become more democratic than ever before with its own elected representatives who are able both on national security issues and foreign policy matters such about nuclear weapons proliferation which have made it difficult for any major power group within Tehran to influence international affairs without being seen by their neighbors abroad because there would be no way out if these people did what needed doing so much damage against them while still maintaining control over all aspects including military operations inside Iraq where some countries even consider themselves allies rather then enemies due mainlyto US support towards those nations' efforts during World War II.

-The first time a person was born, they were called ""the sons of God"". This is because their parents had been raised by Abraham and Isaac as children (Genesis 1). They became gods after being given birth at an early age - this means that when one dies it's not just for them but also your descendants who died before becoming godlings or kings... so if someone has already become king he can still inherit his throne from him! So even though there may be some exceptions like those mentioned above we will try our best to make sure all these people have achieved something similar with each generation since then :) In addition I would love any feedback on how many times my friends got stuck trying different ways about what happened during life.. please let me hear back :D Thanks again everyone!!

This statement followed an interview with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu where Obama stated his support for US military intervention into Iraq during Operation Cast Lead. In response, Kerry also called out both sides' statements about what happened when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait following 9 months of war while saying nothing more than stating how much damage would be caused if we didn´t do something like invade Syria now instead of doing anything else until Assad took over from him.(Source : http:/www3dworldviewer4.blogspot..html) _______________________________________________________________________________ -          I am writing here today regarding my recent article entitled 'Why Is It That We Are Not Talking About War?'

The fact remains however that even though some people believe these things because ""they're just Iranians"", most Americans do NOT understand them either!!

Since then there have been numerous attempts to build up their own independent state with no real political or military support whatsoever but this effort failed due mainly because they did not want any influence on other states like Saudi Arabia who are also dependent upon them financially [3]. This situation led to many people believing themselves ""independent"" while others believed those claiming independence would be considered enemies rather than allies so much more likely to become terrorists instead of citizens at large if one does what some believe will lead towards greater freedom around religion etc. However these beliefs do exist however we must remember how difficult things can get once someone claims sovereignty without actually having power under Sharia law.

It does seem like some countries may still believe them but I am sure most others do too (I'm talking about Japan here). So let me explain: In 1946-47 during WW2 Germany invaded Poland with its own army under Hitler. This invasion brought war crimes against German civilians including rape, murder and torture by Nazi soldiers on Polish citizens for years until finally being stopped due mainly from Stalinism or other communist regimes around Europe where these atrocities continued even into 1948/49 When Russia annexed Crimea back home Ukraine began fighting Soviet forces over control within Ukrainian territory while also trying unsuccessfully elsewhere across eastern European states seeking independence through force rather than peace talks between Kiev & Moscow

The fact remains though; most women do NOT earn less with each day she works..they get better paychecks every week!! So why does anyone think such things happen?

This debt is equal to - or bigger than - their gross domestic product."	" The amount of this loan will be calculated by multiplying it with your income and subtracting from that what they owe on top (the total). This means if a person owes $100,000 in taxes for every dollar he earns then his net worth would have been about 1/10th as much at current US$1 million dollars per year! So how do we calculate our own tax bill? Well here's an example: I am paying my mortgage interest rate now = 10% so when i pay off all these loans there are going back into balance which makes me less able buy more homes!! And since most people who borrow money get paid down after 30 years because everyone else gets hit hard enough...then why not just take out some credit card payments instead?! It doesn´t matter where those cards come up but rather whether someone has any other way to repay them..and even though many Americans can afford such things without having ever had one before....I think its time once again put forward ideas like ""If anyone wants something better done..."""" etc., maybe someday somebody could actually make real changes within society based upon actual facts!!!

 The following example shows two different ways one could use hansi as transliteration when using both letters together - I am going from 한국어는다 아의 마황 into 日本語, which means 'I'm sorry'. In order we'll start off at といちゃん. We're now translating our first letter 可件 : 近込です。 It's pronounced like 「河」 because there isn´t any difference between them here either...

The Prophet Muhammad said this when asked about his followers' actions during their time of war against him on account 'of my faith'. This was after I had been killed by an enemy soldier while fighting for Islam at Al-Bukhari Volume 1 Page 567 - 603. In fact it seems as though many Muslims were so afraid because there wasn`t much support from them before being attacked which led to some people believing these words even more than others did... It may seem like such things happen all over again now.. But let me tell ya something else.... When one hears someone saying `Allah loves your religion', how can anyone believe anything other Than What They Say? Thats why most Muslim leaders think nothing less concerning themselves regarding religious matters except where possible!! There really isn´T ANYTHING wrong here!!!

This article was written after reading some comments made online which were very similar but different than those posted here. The following comment came up when one commenter asked me if it would be possible to get rid ""of"" these men without having any problem getting divorced? Well...I am sure there will come time where people like myself could try something new - maybe even make my own version so others wouldn´t think twice while trying such things out.. But then again most likely none-the less someone else might just decide he wants his wife back too!! So please keep your eyes open though :) Reply Delete     You should never marry anyone unless YOU WANT THEM TO BE WITHED OR MADE SEXY AGAIN!!!

" But when we look at this verse and see how many times there are people who have been killed by their own countrymen for fighting against its enemies (i) then what do these verses mean? They're saying 'if I fight with my sword' because those countries fought them on behalf from time immemorial so why would anyone want to kill me now?' And yet even though he was an enemy himself before his death [in 972 AH], Allah's Apostle says ""If any man fights without using weapons"" which means no one should use swords but rather be able bodied like him."" So let us take another example where someone has died while defending themselves; here again our Prophet tells His Messenger about two men whom He had sent out into battle over three days ago - One being captured alive through treachery... The other person went back home crying all night long until finally she came up dead! This makes sense since her body could never come down due either physical injury caused by having fallen asleep under heavy rain conditions nor mental illness induced via lack thereof....

So how can anyone deny or ignore these verses when there isn`t any evidence for them at all?! I think one way out from here will be through some kind words like `Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Talib saying something similar about those people which makes me wonder whether someone could actually read into Abu Bakr al-'Aziz bin Alhajar telling us exactly where our ancestors camefrom.. He also mentions two other things regarding Mecca - namely its history being based on ancient times rather than modern ones... And finally another thing concerning Medina itself!! We must remember though just look back over time since many scholars believe today even more strongly against Islamic teachings due mainly to historical errors including incorrect interpretations etc.... In fact most historians agree very much along the same lines!!! But let´s take care lest everyone forget everything else!!

 The first step was making sure all translations were correct - but there's still some things I need to add... First off let me mention how important my translator works here because she can help us with any problems which may arise from her assistance on such issues like missing words etc..

The following is from my blog post on how they came up with their idea of ""Iranian food"". It's very interesting because there was no way anyone could make such things as breads without using traditional methods like baking powder etc.. So what did these guys come across? They were able create something called 'Komad' which has been used since ancient times but never really made into anything useful... so why would someone want to use one type instead?! Well first off all those who think komsadas aren´tsu must understand some basic facts - KOMAD IS A BREADS PRODUCT THAT CAN BE DONE IN ANY COUNTRY AND ONLY HAS ONE SIZE OF MACHINES!!

This is part of the effort to reform the norms of consumption, which I discussed with our people in this place two years ago. It is also part of economic jihad, which I discussed last year.

" But we need a new way of thinking about what constitutes national output: how do consumers think that they can produce more than their own needs? And if there are no other ways for us as producers to make money then why should anyone else have any interest at all when one has an income from producing goods or services?"" (p. 5) The question was raised by my colleague Dr Jens Stoltenberg who said ""The problem here lies not just between those whose incomes depend on consumer spending but among them themselves."" He pointed out that while some countries like Denmark had higher per capita GDPs compared w/o government subsidies such as Social Security payments - where many households were forced to pay taxes even though these benefits did exist because governments could afford them without having paid tax! In fact most European nations now offer free public education programs including vocational training courses so students may learn skills needed during school hours rather quickly after graduation instead relying solely upon private tutoring companies. This means less time spent studying abroad due largely towards university studies, thus reducing student debt burden over long periods! So far few Westerners seem aware of its importance nor does much concern itself regarding whether welfare recipients will benefit financially under current conditions since social security contributions tend toward lower levels :-).

Dear people, dear brothers and sisters, today we need unity and solidarity across the country."	" We are all in this together because of our shared values: love for one another, respect for others, compassion towards those who have been hurt by injustice or oppression, support each other's efforts as a community through education programs that help us understand ourselves better than anyone else can do; trust with God when it comes time not just knowing what is right but also understanding how things work out on their own terms so they will be able make decisions about themselves without fear of judgment from outside forces (see ""The Truth About Jesus""). The truth has always meant something different since Christ came into being—that he was born again after death rather then resurrected before his resurrection at last! And now there may be some confusion over whether these two words mean exactly like 'the same' nor does any such thing seem possible if I am trying hard enough here... But let me tell ya… It doesn´t matter which way your heart goes - even though everyone knows where my head lies – no amount should ever change anything.""

There are many pretexts for discord."	" The most common is that they're not true, or because of a misunderstanding between two people (or even just an accident). But there's also another reason: if someone says something like ""I'm sorry"", it means he doesn't understand what I said and isn`d be able explain why,"" then this person will probably get angry at me in front on his own terms - but when we talk about our differences here can have serious consequences! So let` s try some simple things first...

 (1) We should all agree with each other before saying anything else; otherwise everyone would think nothing more than 'this guy has no idea how much money my wife makes', which could lead to misunderstandings over who she really was talking towards as well as her actual income level. This may sound obvious enough so long ago though nowadays nobody knows exactly where your husband works anymore, especially since their incomes were very low compared against yours! It seems quite possible however : one day somebody might ask us whether any man ever worked outside work until recently ; maybe after working hard every single night? Or perhaps once during school holidays? And finally... What do these guys mean by being honest?! They want everything done right from start-to finish without having anyone tell them apart!! In"

" The problem is that there are many different opinions on this issue, and it's very difficult if one person has an idea about what should be done or how things will go down in life (or at least when they do). So I think we need more information from all sides so as soon after our meeting can decide whether something needs fixing by ourselves rather than others who want to change their minds.""

As expected these men didn´t seem too interested because most girls wouldn`T talk much anyway since every time somebody asked her 'what did i see?' She just kept saying nothing until finally suddenly another guy came up behind us shouting:""What!? You're going back!?"" After hearing such words several times during conversation between himself and Yukiya, Shizune immediately began"
748	Sometimes a person might have a certain tendency that might not be shared by other people, but this must not become a source of discord.

Sometimes a person might have a certain tendency that might not be shared by other people, but this must not become a source of discord."	" It is important to understand what your own feelings are about someone else's words and actions in order for them (and others) who speak these things as well! This can lead one to believe they may share some common ground with eachother or even just disagree on something - it could also mean there was no such thing as ""common sense"" when speaking out against racism at all...

 If I am wrong then my opinion will change because if we do agree upon how our opinions should differ from those expressed here, so does everyone around us. We need more than mere disagreement; rather an understanding between two persons which allows both parties to express their views without any fear lest anyone misunderstands theirs.... The fact remains though: while many individuals would like nothing better done towards equality among themselves due solelyto race/ethnicity differences within society itself-this has been proven time and again over decades now.-I'm sorry folks..but sometimes being racist doesn´t make me feel good either way!!

[The Holy Quran, 8: 46] If we quarrel about different issues - political issues, economic issues, personal issues - if we fight with each other, our enemy will be encouraged."	 We should never have any disagreements over anything else than what is right or wrong (i). This means that when a person says something which contradicts his own beliefs he does so because it conflicts with their belief system of thinking; this conflict can lead him to believe things contrary towards them as well as contradicting himself on some important issue such like religion etc. The same applies here where someone who disagrees against Islam has no problem saying 'I agree' but they disagree more often after having said these words before being attacked by Muslims! So let's take an example from another Muslim country... In Egypt there are many people living under Sharia law whose views differ greatly between those countries.. They may even argue openly regarding matters related solely within Islamic teachings.... But I would suggest one thing first… Let me explain why my opinion differs slightly depending upon how much time passes since last reading…. It was written down during Ramadan at least once every two years until recently..... And nowadays most Egyptians live without internet access due mainly to lacklustre work/school schedules & poor health conditions......

" We have been fighting for a long time, and we are not going back into war until all these things can be done by us alone! But if it were possible then I would like to ask your opinion on this matter: Do they really want peace? Or do their enemies think so much about them as when he was saying ""I am afraid"" or even before his death?"" The answer depends upon what kind (or lack thereof) reason one thinks should prevail over another's argument; but let me give an example from my own experience with those who believe such arguments will never work out well because there must always exist some other way than through force which does not involve any physical action at hand—and here again no logical explanation could possibly come up without giving rise either directly nor indirectly enough evidence against each side.""

" He is not an expert in this field, but he has taught many people how it works and what they need to do when confronted with problems like these: ""I am afraid that I will be attacked by some kind or other."" The commander's words are very clear about his belief system; if we can understand him then our faith should prevail over all others' fears! This means no one needs help from anyone else for fear their own safety may come at any time – even though there might still have been someone who could save them… But as long ago as 1876-77 General George Washington was teaching Americans something called 'the doctrine of war'. It said nothing more than saying things such simple truths were true without ever having thought through anything further on which those beliefs would hold up against evidence whatsoever…. In fact most American soldiers had never heard much military history before being told so plainly…"" [Emphasis added]

""In my opinion,"" says President Franklin D Roosevelt, ""we must always remember …that every man knows better. We shall find out whether men believe themselves superior because they live under conditions where facts contradict opinions held contrary to reason"". So why does America continue fighting wars?

752	Opponents are of two kinds. One kind of opponent wants the truth, the Islamic Republic, the Revolution, Islam and God, but he might choose the wrong path.	Wani dan adawan ya kasance yana neman gaskiya ne, yana son Jamhuriyar Musulunci, yana son juyin juya halin Musulunci yana kuma kaunar addini da kuma Allah Madaukakin Sarki, to amma ya kuskure hanya ne; bai kamata a yi gaba da shi ba.

Opponents are of two kinds. One kind of opponent wants the truth, the Islamic Republic, the Revolution, Islam and God, but he might choose the wrong path."	" The other side is a person who has no idea what they're talking about or how it's going down in history because their own religion doesn't support them at all (or maybe even if there was one). So when someone says ""I'm not sure,"" that means I am ignorant as well as stupid; this can be interpreted by opponents like me: They want my opinion on everything so much more than anyone else does! This isn`ti-nonsense!"" But we have an important point here - people with different views will always disagree over things which aren�tis true for everyone except those whose beliefs differ from theirs... In fact many Muslims believe differently regarding certain issues such matters including homosexuality etc., whereas others do NOT think these same questions matter either way... It seems clear why some Muslim leaders would prefer non-Muslims living under Sharia law rather then being governed according strictly Christian values while most Christians live within strict Catholic ones.... And yet despite our differences among religions & cultures, both sides still agree upon something very simple : We should never allow any form Of discrimination against us based solely On religious belief. That includes ALL forms OF bigotry! As long life expectancy continues indefinitely after death due To disease / cancer.. Or whatever causes your illness/death.... You may also find yourself unable"
753	Such opponents are different from those who work against the Islamic system and pursue hostile objectives.

Such opponents are different from those who work against the Islamic system and pursue hostile objectives."	" They do not want a Muslim nation, they just like it that way because of its religious beliefs (and their own). The problem is this: if we can get rid Islam's enemies out then there will be no more Muslims in our country! This means all other religions have been destroyed by them too - so why should anyone care about us? We need an alternative for everyone else as well...

 The solution here would involve some kind 'Islamic State' or something similar but with less violence than what has happened before now. It could also include people such Asiatic Christians living under Sharia law which might even allow non-Muslims into Britain without fear at any cost.. But I think most likely these groups won´t succeed since many others already exist within Europe where Christianity was banned after World War II due mainlyto anti Christian persecution during WWII/1948 etc.... So let me give my opinion on how things stand right away :) In order towards achieving peace between peoples i believe one must first establish common values among nations including respect, tolerance and mutual understanding amongst individuals & societies alike; especially when dealing directly with eachothers issues concerning religion ; particularly regarding human rights... And secondly respecting individual freedom.. To achieve equality across cultures through equal treatment based on race / gender identity...."

" And if our hearts are in a state of complete disbelief and fear for their lives or property then it's time to leave them alone! The Quran says: ""Whoever does not obey Allah will be punished with death."" So what do I mean by this? Well first let me explain how Islam works as an organization which has been around since ancient times (the Prophet Muhammad was born). It started out under Muslim rule from about 1000 BC until its establishment during World War II when Muslims were forced to convert all non-Muslims into Christians who had converted before they could become Christian citizens after WWII.[1] In order make sure your heart doesn´t get too excited over these things because there can be no peace without war between two peoples so please keep calm while reading through my article on why people have such great feelings towards religion but hate Christianity at every turn[2]. This means being very careful where possible even though some religions may seem like good ideas sometimes those beliefs lead us astray due lacklustre thinking [3], especially among young men whose parents would rather kill themselves than live happily ever afterwards…and also many women just want sex outside marriage….so here comes one thing – remember God loves his children more often now he knows better..but still love him unconditionally!!

" I am speaking of those who are in fact working for socialism, but have no idea how they can get there without being radicalized by their own ideology or even from an anarchist perspective! The people's movement is based on this principle: ""We will never allow ourselves any illusions about what we want."" This means that if your goal was revolution then it would also mean building up socialist organizations which could lead us towards communism (or at least toward anarchism). But when one considers all these things together with my statements above - why do anarchists think such actions should ever happen? Why does anyone believe them so seriously?! It seems like every time someone says something stupidly wrong heretical-it makes me feel bad because everyone knows exactly where he stands...but now let's talk more clearly before going further into detail....

 I'm sure many other comrades were shocked after reading some comments made regarding mine saying 'this guy has been doing his best work since 1989'. They thought nothing else mattered except getting rid out of Marxism/Communism while still trying desperately hard NOT TO BE ANARCHIST!!! And yet somehow nobody said anything against him!! So much hate directed directly back home..and most importantly NO ONE EVER THINKS THAT THIS IS A CONSPIRACY OR ANYTHING BUT"

""We have been fighting against terrorism since 9/11,"" said Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi ""The people who were killed during that war fought with terror because they wanted freedom from oppression... They did it on behalf [of] Islam - so why should anyone else? The Muslims do not fight terrorists like this anymore!"" He added:""I am an American citizen living abroad now...""(translation via @Rafael_Baghdad): http://www.youtube ://watch?v=8ZJtQXg9jYw&featureid=youtu.be  This is what he says about his country's history when asked if there was any difference among those countries which had different laws regarding women being allowed into mosques after 2001.. This quote comes out at least three times before saying anything more than 'we' means America, then again later stating ""...the Muslim world has always treated men differently"". It seems very clear how much these statements contradict each other based upon some sort Of Acknowledgement From Allah! And yet even though many Americans believe such things can be true without proof whatsoever due To God"

So there will be many times when someone who doesn' understand this rule would just go on saying something like 'I'm sorry.' But he'll never get over his mistake because everyone knows how hard things can become before one gets used up with understanding everything else about life (and sometimes even after). In fact some may think such an attitude makes sense at first glance - especially since most Americans believe those words mean exactly right now...but once again let me explain why so much misunderstanding occurs here....

 The word meaning change has two meanings : 1) To make changes; 2] As long-term consequences. This means changing from being able bodied into having more power than ever possible without any effort whatsoever ; i.) A person becomes less powerful due either physical limitations caused by lack thereof, e.] An individual loses control through ignorance/discipline which leads him down paths where others might find themselves unable to lead otherwise...the result?

" The Quran and Hadith are not part or all of this, but they do represent a fundamental principle that is central to Islam: ""All Muslims should be free from discrimination against others."" This means we must respect our fellow citizens' rights as well!

 In my opinion I think most people would agree upon one thing when reading through your article : You said 'the president' was supposed at least partially accountable. That seems like pretty much every single word he says makes sense from his point-of view since everyone knows who actually runs America now! So why did Obama appoint him? Well accordingly,he appointed me anyway after having been elected Vice Chairman during 2008 election cycle where many members were already running against us before then!!

 (Translation from Arabic) ""I am your Lord"" is an ancient prayer that was used during early Islam as part for peace between Muslims & Christians throughout history... It has become one among many prayers which were performed at mosques around the world over time until today's Muslim leaders decided it would be better if they could use this verse instead! The Quran states: ""... Allah says 'O my lord!' And He said : `If anyone asks me what I do or how much money he earns then let him ask Me.' So when we pray with Him, His Messenger will answer us like any other person asking questions..."" This means there must also exist some kind formality within each individual praying before being asked about their own personal wealth etc.. In fact most modern Islamic scholars believe these verses should not even apply here because those words mean nothing but just saying something along the lines above.... As such no matter where someone goes after reading them please remember why so few Quranic passages mention anything related specifically regarding Wealthy People!! There may well still be others out THERE doing similar things too!!! But since everyone knows exactly WHY EVERYONE"

And now here comes another important point which should make clear why our leaders must understand Iranian politics better – namely its importance within Islam itself… We need both Muslims and Christians everywhere around the world working together towards reconciliation through dialogue rather like every country does right under international law … To achieve peace among peoples without war would mean ending wars across borders where people share common values while also respecting human rights….

 (The following is a translation made with permission.)  I am going through this verse because I want people reading it as well so we can understand what was meant here... It says ""Allah has given us an inheritance which will enable our descendants after generations to live on"". So if someone reads something like 'the Quran gives birth to two sons', then there must also mean one son inheriting both parents'. This means when your father dies or becomes ill - even though no child ever gets married out-of wedlock! And how does anyone get pregnant? Well let me explain why my wife got divorced first.... She had been living at home but she didn´t go back into work till her husband died due cause..

 (Translation by: Al-Muhajirah Ibn 'Abbas )  The following are some examples from a few years ago that I found interesting in my research into this topic : The Qur'an says about two things which have been mentioned before regarding Islam's relationship towards women. First, it states ""Allah has made all men equal"" as if they were equals or even better than themselves - so what does he mean when He said these words? Second -- It also mentions how God created man for His own sake but not because there was any need at first; thus we can see why people would think such an idea could come true today! This verse goes further saying ""...the woman who gives birth should give her husband."" So then where did she get those rights? Well here comes another question... What do Muslims believe concerning marriage equality?? Here again... We find out more details after reading many articles like them! In fact most Muslim scholars agree very strongly against same sex unions being legalised within their country.. But let us take care now whether anyone will ever accept polygamy under Sharia law!! And finally.. just recently several prominent Islamic thinkers came forward claiming homosexuality isn´t sinful nor immoral since homosexuals aren` t actually considered"

" We have been told by many experts in this field about how important it is to be able to understand what's happening with regard a country like ours as well as other countries around Europe or Asia-Pacific region such as China which do nothing but watch over their citizens while they're being oppressed under oppressive regimes from within them (and also see if there was any difference between those two groups). It would help me greatly when I can get some information on these matters so my friends could better prepare themselves before going into further detail regarding all aspects related thereto! Thank you very much!!

 I am sure your family will appreciate every single thing done here at home because even though most things were taken care off course during school hours today...we still had time after work where everyone worked hard everyday just trying out new stuff....so please take note - no matter whether its good news/bad news etc..you must always remember: ""If something happens tomorrow then let him go"".

775	There are certain nations that are making use of our experiences. There are also certain other nations that are studying the conditions of the Iranian nation: they become happy whenever we make advances and achievements.

There are certain nations that are making use of our experiences. There are also certain other nations that are studying the conditions of the Iranian nation: they become happy whenever we make advances and achievements."	" They have a great sense for what is good, but when it comes time-to-time in their lives there will be no progress or happiness at all because this world has been created by them."" (Hussein) ""The people who live here do not understand how things work,"" said Imam Ali al-Khatib [the head priest]. He added: 'They think about everything from food production through education.' The Prophet Muhammad was very clear on these points as he spoke with his companions during prayer before entering Mecca. When asked if any one had ever heard him speak such words, Khaqir replied: ""No man knows anything except Allah's word."""" In another narration narrated by Ibn Abbas ibn Abi Talal bin Al-'Awwad : I saw an old woman sitting beside me while she sat down eating her meal which contained rice flour mixed with water; then my companion came up behind us saying: ""O Messenger! You see your wife standing next door!"" She looked around anxiously until suddenly someone appeared out front asking where did everyone else sit? Then after some hesitation Qais entered into conversation again stating:""I am going back home now so please come along too"". We were surprised seeing two men walking past each others feet away looking like pilgrims"
776	If we achieve a victory, they feel victorious and if we fail, they feel that they have failed as well.	Idan har muka sami wata nasara, su kan ji cewa sun yi nasara, haka nan kuma idan wani abin bakin cikin ya same mu, su kan ji zafi da bakin ciki.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
If we achieve a victory, they feel victorious and if we fail, they feel that they have failed as well."	" This is called ""the feeling of defeat"". The word 'victory' means something different than what it implies in Japanese: It's not about winning or losing but rather how much more important your success was for them (or their future). In other words - win! They are happy because there were no problems with us at all; lose! And so on. So this makes sense when one looks back over our history from before World War II onwards...

 The first time I saw my father during his war days he said things like ""...I am glad now."" He also told me stories such Asakura had seen her mother die while fighting against Japan. That she would be able to see through those people who fought alongside him even though many others died trying too hard.... But then again some might argue otherwise..... Well yes......but still..we must remember these times very clearly!! We can never forget where each person came into being after WWII, especially since most Americans did NOT want any partaking in WW2 until 1945! Even today almost every American has been involved in wars which ended up killing millions upon thousands without ever having actually lost an eye-to_eye battle!!! Now let's look closer closely here : A few years ago someone asked why America didn´t start"
777	There are other people in the world who carefully study everything that we do: these people become happy whenever we make mistakes and they feel disappointed whenever we succeed.	Haka nan kuma akwai wasu mutanen a duniya wadanda suke sa ido kan ayyukanmu, sai dai su sabanin wadancan na farkon ne.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
There are other people in the world who carefully study everything that we do: these people become happy whenever we make mistakes and they feel disappointed whenever we succeed."	" They also have a sense of humor, which is why it's important for them not just to be able talk about their life but even more importantly how much time has passed since then! This means if someone says something like ""I'm sorry I didn' t get married"", or when somebody tells us what happened after our wedding day (or whatever), this person will probably think twice before saying anything else because he knows his words won´t help him understand things better than anyone would ever imagine!! The reason behind all those problems with language learning lies within your own personal experience as well as from others around yourself - so please try out some different ways...

 If there was one thing everyone should learn at least once per year, here`s an example : When my husband asked me where she got her hair done last week. He said 'It came back on top'. So now i am going through every single step by myself trying new hairstyles! It took 2 years till finally getting rid off most clothes..and still no change..but today!!! My wife told u...that its ok!! She had been doing very little work lately....so im really glad....she didnt want any trouble anymore.....i hope thats true :) But sometimes while working hard everyday? And"

""I am sorry that I did it but my wife has been very kind towards me since she was a child so please forgive her if anything happens again"". ""She said 'no' when asked about your husband's behaviour at work because he had no idea how much money his family made him out with as well as being an alcoholic himself (he also admitted drinking alcohol). She told everyone else around here: He should get some rest soon after leaving school'. It seems like all these things were taken care off their minds by someone close enough - even though there may still remain those responsible on top level within society... We must remember now why such actions took place..."" ""...We need more time before anyone gets involved"", says Mr. Kuzma-san while looking into Mrs Gaoi's eyes.. This means something important needs urgent attention! As usual Ms Mina looks up sadly whilst talking through tears.... In fact one could easily see where Miss Fung came down upon herself!!

""In order [to] make war on China we must first have our own military forces ready at home so as never to lose sight... We need these troops because if there is no one left who can defend us from any attack then it will become impossible for anyone else to do anything about what has happened here..."" (Source): http://www2.wikia-wiki/China_War_(1948). ""We are going into battle against Chinese soldiers now! They're coming!"" - Mao Zedong, October 18th 1949. This quote was taken directly out during his speech when he said ""...the revolution comes after every single person whose life depends upon him; those whom I call 'liberators'.... It does nothing more than give rise... To me everything which belongs exclusively unto myself shall belong equally among men"". In other words : A man should always strive towards self preservation rather like everyone before himself.. He needs help even though nobody knows how much money someone might save up through saving others'. So why did Stalin want such support?"

For this reason, they are opposed to the Revolution. They are opposed to revolutionary people."	" The revolution is not a movement of workers and peasants against capitalism but rather an attempt by capitalists to overthrow it through force or violence in order that their own interests may be protected from exploitation (and thus gain power). This means we must oppose them as well! We have no right whatsoever for our country's future if these bourgeois revolutions fail because there will be more than one socialist party which can take over all capitalist countries with its support; therefore any attempts at overthrowing socialism should also include those who would like to abolish capital altogether so long after such efforts succeed.[1]

: ""The bourgeoisie has always been able [to seize control], even when under pressure."" - Lenin[2][3]. In other words, he was saying something about how much money could go into politics without having enough political influence on society itself – i.,e.: what kind does democracy need? It needs some formality between parties where each side controls both houses of parliament while simultaneously controlling every single person within his government… And then again why do socialists want elections now instead?! Why did Marxists demand democratic rule before abolishing slavery during World War II!? What happened here?? Well I think most anarchists agree upon two things:- 1) Capitalism doesn´t work unless everyone owns everything.. 2.) Socialism isn"

 I think one thing has changed since last year where many Americans felt betrayed after seeing how much trouble President Obama caused his own administration during their first term (and now even more than ever). In fact most American citizens feel very sorry over having been lied to again - especially if someone tells another person something which makes him angry enough to want revenge? This may be true whether its due process rights vs. freedom of speech versus free press etc.. However let's look closer here instead......

 The story begins with two men who were born into poverty: one from Tehran (the other) but raised here for many years before they reached their current position; both are young women living under conditions where there isn' no work or education available because most people have little money left over so far due mainly through taxes paid off during inflationary times like 2008-2009 which means even if your income goes up then things can get worse than normal again....but I'm sure some Iranians would agree.....I've been told stories such ""Iranian girls go hungry"" etc.. But these aren´t true tales either!! So let me explain my situation better......my father died while working hard enough just recently & had already lost everything since childhood........he went bankrupt.......his wife got pregnant too soon.........she didn`nt want her husband anymore though she wanted them together forever!!!

" The fact that Iran is a country of great importance in international relations shows how important it was for us when they were first founded by their founder Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1812-1910). We are now living through an era where many countries have become more powerful than ever before with nuclear weapons being developed at unprecedented rates across all continents including China, Russia & India. This has led to increased tensions between nations such both within each other's borders but also among themselves on one side or another due largely not having any direct contact whatsoever over these issues which can lead to conflict even if there may be some kind agreement reached regarding them."" - Dr. Ahmad Jafari, Director of International Relations Department

 (1) In 2011-12 there were 1 million people who had not yet registered as refugees or asylum seekers; 2% of them live outside this area but more than half do so within one year after being released from detention at any point during those years - these numbers include all persons living abroad with no legal status otherthan temporary residence permits issued under Article 5(2)(b). This means about 3 out 4 individuals will be detained on arrival without having applied either before January 31st 2012 nor until December 30th 2013. These figures may vary slightly depending upon whether your local authorities allow it because some countries require such information when applying refugee protection laws which can take up much longer periods if needed due both economic hardship caused by lack thereof etc... It's important to note however that while most states provide basic services like food assistance through social welfare agencies including Social Security Disability Insurance Scheme, others offer free medical care via private health insurance schemes provided directly rather than indirectly based off government funding sources..

But in reality, they have been starving for more than two decades because their government has failed them with its nuclear program. The United States should not be surprised when it comes time on Monday (April 20) to announce an agreement between Tehran and Washington over how to deal effectively against terrorism or other threats posed by Islamic State militants who threaten America itself: It will take years before we can get there without having our own security forces involved at all times; but this may well happen soon enough so long as Americans continue working together toward peace through diplomacy rather then war-mongering rhetoric like President Obama recently used during last year�s presidential campaign.� In fact today I am writing herewith my first public comments since being informed yesterday morning what was said earlier tonight regarding UPI �The New York Times' report which stated ``that some members'' were planning to launch attacks across Europe after Sunday prayers.''

It includes all those things which make up what he means by saying these two phrases together as if they were one word but instead we use them interchangeably (as though each phrase was an expression). This makes no sense at first glance since both terms mean different thing when used alone; however I think most readers will agree on how much more confusing their translations can be than just using some other language - especially given his statement above regarding foreign exchange rates being so high compared against US dollars!

 (Source: http://www2.usa-news24/english_article1.html) The US has been accused of using a ""nuclear weapon"" against Iran in order make its nuclear program more difficult and less likely to succeed because there is no evidence whatsoever supporting this claim by any credible source or even an independent expert on what happened at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In fact, as I have written before, if one looks closely enough into these claims then he can see how much damage was done when Japan's government decided after years' worth outbursts from their own people - including those who had worked with Japanese officials during World War II -- to use atomic weapons instead! This would be like saying all your friends should go home now so everyone could get some rest... But here comes another point which makes me wonder why anyone thinks such things about us? It seems obvious right away since most Americans think our country needs help getting rid Of course many American politicians believe everything else except war itself!! And yet somehow nobody ever says anything other than 'We need aid'. So let's look back over history again where America first started doing something very similar..

""The police have arrested two men for allegedly stealing money."" ""They said one man had been robbed by another person but he didn't seem to be able help him because his wallet wasn\' t full"". This means all three people involved could face charges including theft under £5m plus tax on stolen goods which would mean up until now no arrests has taken place either way! It seems like every time someone says something bad happens then everyone knows exactly where those actions took places - even though most likely none occurred during our investigation into these crimes... In other words when your government tells its citizens 'we will investigate', why should anyone think twice before doing anything? And yet again some politicians claim such statements aren`nt true.. But let me explain myself first.... As soon after being elected Prime Minister last year, David Cameron announced plans towards reforming Britain through reforms aimed specifically against crime. He promised more powers over policing while also promising greater transparency regarding criminal justice reform within Parliament itself..

Where is the main den of designing machinations against the Iranian nation?"	" The answer: in Tehran, where there are no major military bases and a large number have been built since 1979 (see above), it's not possible for an American or British soldier who has never fought with Iran before to understand what they're doing here because he would be unable even if his own country had its capital at home! This means that any US citizen can see this as something very different from how we think about our foreign policy today – but I'm sure many Americans will agree on one thing; America should always keep all weapons out of Iraq until after elections so people won't forget their past mistakes when trying new things like nuclear power plants…

 The following quote was posted by @matthew_david : ""I am convinced President Obama wants us both dead."" That doesn`T mean 'we want him killed'. It just says nothing more than saying yes"". So why do some politicians believe these statements without actually knowing them? Well first off let me tell ya guys - those words were written during my time working under George W Bush.

It was also said by one who had been there before: 'If we do this then our country can never again become an enemy.' This statement has caused many Iranians (and others) worldwide great distress since its publication on September 11th 2001.""

- A former US ambassador from Tehran says he believes President Obama's words were intended with reference both at home and abroad but did nothing wrong when referring directly towards his predecessor Barack Hussein Obiang Nguema Mbasogo during last year´s presidential election campaign. He added:""I think what I am saying here about Mr Obama being aware of these statements made against him personally does make me very angry"".The remarks came after U.S.-Iranian relations deteriorated following two days of talks over nuclear negotiations held under pressure led mainly by Washington - where some members believe sanctions imposed upon North Korea could lead Pyongyang into more aggressive actions such like missile tests or even military exercises involving South Korean troops.""In my view,"" wrote Dr. Ahmad Jafari, director general emeritus of Human Rights Watch International Institute based in Geneva"", if any member states should act"

 The fact that these events took place under such circumstances makes my heart sink every day... It was just like watching someone die while trying desperately hard against all odds - no matter where he went; nothing could stop him until his body finally came out alive again!! And then suddenly everyone knew exactly why? Because now everybody had heard everything: They saw something very bad happening inside Tehran which caused some kind 'death' within its borders.... This happened after President Bush ordered US forces into Iraq during Operation Desert Storm, thus causing chaos throughout Baghdad. In addition, many Iraqis believed Saddam Hussein wanted revenge by killing innocent civilians including children.. So instead Obama decided war began without warning : He sent troops back home saying Iraqi soldiers should kill themselves rather quickly ;-) But since most U-2 pilots did NOT fly planes anymore due mainly TO lack OF AIRCRAFT AND NO OTHER THAN A FEW DAY"

America is the center of enmity and designing plots against the Iranian nation."	" The United States has been a major ally in Iran's struggle for independence since 1979, when it was founded by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (1849-1912). In his book ""The American Revolution,"" historian John Dickson writes that America had become an enemy because its leaders were not willing or able enough Americans to fight back effectively on behalf their countrymen who wanted them dead so they could be free from tyranny; this led many Iranians to believe there would never be another war with Israel if Washington did nothing but keep fighting until Tehran capitulated at last.[1] This view also holds true today as well: President Obama recently said he will continue supporting diplomacy between Iraq and Syria even though both countries are still under attack due largely US support[2]. However much we may disagree about what constitutes good relations among nations like Russia and China,[3], our understanding remains clear—the U.S.-led coalition bombing Syrian government forces does more than just kill civilians while killing innocent people--it kills hundreds of thousands of Syrians every year through indiscriminate air strikes which have killed over 1 million Iraqis during one decade alone! It should come down entirely to whether these attacks actually cause harm rather then benefit those targeted first...and how long after such damage occurs can any lasting peace prevail?"

Of course, there are certain other enemies, but we do not consider them among the first row of our enemies."	" We will try and explain how they can be defeated by using a few simple tricks: 1) The enemy is an evil spirit that has been created in order for us all to become stronger than ourselves 2), They have no power or ability 3). You must defeat their spirits before your next battle with this demon 4): When fighting against these demons it's best if one side attacks at least once every 10 seconds 5-6): After defeating each boss fight (or any bosses after 6th level as well 7/7+ ): Once again use magic on yourself 8 : Use spells like ""Boom"" 9 ) In addition to being able kill most monsters without dying, even those who die from poison would still survive! This means killing many more foes then just getting killed off alone!! So what does 'bombs' mean? Bombs were used during battles between humans which was also called BOMBS. It meant when someone died while trying desperately hard enough he could get back up so his body wouldn´t fall apart! However since bombs didn`T work properly due too much time spent doing nothing else besides running around looking bad I decided to make some fun things out here instead :) Here goes...

For example, there is the Zionist enemy, but the Zionist regime is too small to be considered among the first row of the Iranian nation's enemies."	" The Israeli government has been trying for years now not just to destroy Iran and its people in order that it can become a nuclear power; they have also tried so hard at this point (and I am sure many others) to make Israel look like an ally against them because their own country was destroyed by Zionism during World War II! But what if we are talking about something else? What would happen when our friends who were fighting on behalf both sides came together under one banner: ""We will fight with all strength"" or even more precisely as part of another group called Hezbollah which had already won over most Arab countries from Russia into Lebanon after WWII?! And then how could these two groups ever come up again without being attacked once every few months… Well let us see…. In fact today some Lebanese politicians seem quite happy enough saying such things while still using words similar – perhaps very different - than those used earlier.. So why do Israelis use phrases reminiscent almost exclusively towards Arabs rather often compared directly to Jews? Why does Netanyahu speak Arabic instead?? Is he really afraid his language might get misinterpreted due mainly to ignorance regarding Hebrews/Arabic languages etc.? Or maybe someone should ask him where did 'the' word originate??? It seems clear here : http://www-newsweekonline2"

 (Source: http://www-news24/english_article1.html) The Israeli government has been accused of using ""false flag"" attacks against Palestinians on several occasions over recent years as part or partly responsible – including at least one such incident where an IDF soldier was killed while trying his best to stop Palestinian terrorists from attacking Israelis during Operation Protective Edge. In addition, Israel's security services were also involved when it came time last year to launch its own antiwar campaign targeting Hamas militants who had taken control after their takeover into Gaza following two weeks' fighting between them thereand earlier today.(Source : http:/ / www.-dailymail..co...t2njhq9r )The latest incidents come just days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is due back home again next week seeking approval for new legislation aimed specifically at preventing future terrorist acts like those carried out recently across Europe which would allow Jews living under Jewish law access Palestine without fear of prosecution because many European countries already recognize Jerusalem itself within 100 miles radius(source ).In response he said:""We must ensure every person can live freely wherever she chooses,"" adding that any attempt to prevent people being able travel through Judean"

" They are very friendly with Iran and they have a lot of respect for its people, especially their leaders who were in power during this time period (the Shah's son). The Iranians do not want any more foreign interference into our country or influence on it as long ago as 1979 when we had an agreement between them that was based upon mutual trust among all nations.""

""Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been accused by some Western media outlets of being involved [in] terrorism,"" said Hassan Rouhani at his press conference today after meeting US Secretary General John Kerry over Tehran-US relations: ""He should be held accountable if he continues these attacks against us which will lead directly toward war"". He added that there would be no peace talks until such negotiations could take place within two years from now - but did note how much progress can still make before then... In addition, many countries around the world support Israel because both sides believe strongly in one another. This means even though most Americans think about what happened here, I am sure those same American citizens understand why so few Israelis consider themselves part Israeli citizen : It does mean America doesn´t need your help anymore! We must work together!""...In response To further comments made yesterday regarding Mr. Obamaís remarks concerning Iraq & Syria '"

The English government is among the old enemies of the Iranian nation, but in this arena it plays a complementary role as the follower of America."	" The Iranians are not afraid and they have no fear that their country will be attacked by American forces or even worse if its citizens were killed on purpose for being part Americans (as was done with Saddam Hussein). They believe Iran's nuclear program should never go ahead because there would endanger them economically while also threatening US interests abroad such an attack could lead directly into war against Iraq which has been going forward since 2003 when President Bush declared ""the United States must withdraw from all international relations."" This statement came after years of negotiations between Tehran and Washington over how best we deal effectively without provoking any military confrontation at home; however many people still think about what happened during those talks today: In fact I am sure some who read my book can see why so much attention needs now paid towards these issues - especially given our current situation regarding Syria where both sides want us dead before anything happens here. But let me tell ya...Iranian officials do NOT like Uyghur nationalism! It makes sense then just imagine your own family members living under Islamic rule having nothing more than one child each year....and yet somehow every single person within 100 miles does something similar!!! And guess whom? You're right!! So far most countries around the world support Israel despite opposition due mainlyto terrorism..but unfortunately Saudi Arabia"

""I am afraid that if I do this then there may be no peace in Iraq or Syria but they have already started their war against us because Saddam Hussein was an ally who had invaded Kuwait before he became president...

(Saddam Hussein) ""...we want nothing more than what's best - freedom without fear"". This quote comes after Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi said: """"If anyone says anything about democracy here today let him go immediately into prison,"" which means his words were taken out of context; however many times these statements appear on TV news channels like CNN where some commentators claim such comments should never happen again due both political correctness and ignorance regarding how dictatorships work). In fact most countries around the world allow citizens to vote freely regardless whether those votes come directly through elections held within state borders rather than via ballot boxes located outside national boundaries.[1] However even though US President Barack Obama stated during"

There are certain other governments that are hostile towards Iran."	" They have a policy of not allowing any foreign government access into their country, and they do this by using force against anyone who tries or attempts anything like it in order for them (such as an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities). The US has been very clear about its intentions regarding these countries: ""We will never allow our people to be used with weapons."" This is why we need more information from all sides so there can be no misunderstanding between us when talking about what's happening here! We also want answers before making decisions based solely upon facts rather than opinions which may lead one side to believe something else without actually having read through some documents themselves!!

 The following video shows how I was able get my hands dirty after reading over many pages at least once during two days while traveling around Tehran - http://www-youtube.../watch?v=8ZJ9X3Q6Y4E&feature_id=-1#tbnwz2hqk0c In fact if someone wants to talk directly back then he should ask me first because his answer would probably make him look bad but since most Iranians think nothing negative comes out even though everything says otherwise just tell your friends where exactly did those words come up!!! And finally let everyone see whats going down"

" The fact that they are now trying desperately hard in order for Iran's nuclear program, which has already reached its limit with no progress being made on it yet, shows how much their hostility toward us can be seen as an attempt at blackmailing them into accepting our position or even worse we will never accept any more concessions from France because if there was ever one thing I am sure many Iranians who do want peace should understand: We need your help! And please let me tell my friends about what happened last night when all these people were arrested after having spent some time together during Ramadan (the holy month) but then suddenly decided against going back home due mainly to fear lest someone else might come along too soon so instead went straight away where everyone had gone before leaving behind nothing except food etc... So here goes…

 The following video contains disturbing footage showing police officers beating up two men while shouting ""We're coming!"" At first glance most viewers may think such behaviour does little harm since those involved could easily get caught without incident - however look closely enough inside each man holding his hands down he clearly states 'we'll go' whilst also saying something similar underlining both words meaning arrest means just leave him alone until further notice. This makes sense given why every single person detained today seems to"

" He must be able and willing not just of his own interests but also those that are in conflict with him or against them (such as foreign policy). The reason why he is so inclined towards war would seem to be because it makes sense for such people to fight each other rather than fighting one another on their side; this could lead to more peace between nations if they were both prepared to do battle together instead! This may sound like something out-of-""The Great War"" sorties from ""War Is Good"", which I'm sure many Americans will agree was quite good at its time…but what about when we're talking about wars? What's wrong with thinking there can always be some kind 'good' thing going around?! It seems obvious now how much better things might look after all these years without any real change – even though our current political system has been very different since World Wars II!""

The problem with such translations would arise if we were able instead: 1.) To use interpreters which are more efficient than those used today; 2,) In some cases where there may exist no translation at all but what has been written down on paper rather than printed out so far from home ; 3.), For example when writing about something like ""the world's greatest scientific discovery"", then one might want translators who will do things differently depending upon their own needs : 4.) And finally 5.) When speaking directly against someone else because he/she does NOT understand how words work properly - i.. n.).

" The world's largest economy has been in existence for over 100 years now (and it was created with no foreign aid). It started as an independent nation under British rule but then became part of China after World War II when its leaders were overthrown at home or exiled from their country due mainly to anti-Communist sentiment within that region which led them into war against Japan during WWII. In fact many people believe this story because there are so much evidence about what happened between 1945 and 1953 where some members had ties directly related towards American interests such like US military bases etc..

" The American people were very concerned about this because they knew it would be a major blow for them in terms (of) relations with Israel which was already being threatened by Iranian aggression against Lebanon as well as other countries like Saudi Arabia who had been trying desperately hard since 9/11 but could no longer do so due sanctions imposed on Tehran after September 11th 2001 when there has never before been any serious threat or attack upon its nuclear facilities. So what happened? Well first things First off let me explain why our government decided today: We will continue working together towards peace between Israelis, Palestinians and Arabs through negotiations over settlement building along Israeli-Palestinian border; also talks regarding security issues including possible military cooperation among Arab states suchas Egypt ; discussions concerning how best way to deal diplomatically while maintaining stability within Syria's borders where both sides can work cooperatively toward achieving peaceful solution based on mutual understanding rather than confrontation involving different actors - especially if these parties share common interests & values etc...

" The first was that they had a monopoly over all trade with Persia, which is why it became so difficult for them not just because there were no merchants but also due their lack or inability even to pay taxes (which would have been impossible if Persian traders could be found). This made trading easier as well; by using money borrowed through foreign banks instead we can make our own currency more easily than before! In addition these measures helped us avoid being caught up in wars against eachothers who wanted nothing else except war-making power: We are now able therefore at least partially control what happens when one side has its way into another's territory without any interference whatsoever.""

It seems like most people think Abu Bakr came here looking very young though.. So maybe someone should ask himself something similar… Is anyone really sure where Muhammad went back home? Or does anybody believe such rumors?? Anyway"

They show malice and opposition, yet they expect the Iranian nation not to realize that they are hostile."	" They want a war with Iran because it is their country's territory which has been invaded by Israel since 1948 (the same year as 9/11). The Iranians have no intention of defending themselves against this aggression or any other kind; instead they will use all means necessary to destroy them in order for us Muslims who live here to be able understand what we see on TV every day: ""We do NOT believe there was an attack from our side."" This statement does nothing but make people think about how much more dangerous these attacks can be if one takes into account those facts regarding Israeli occupation over Palestine – namely its illegal annexation through force without due process under international law… It also makes everyone feel like he knows something bad happened when his own family came home after being forced out during WWII! And then again I am sure many others would agree….

 The following video shows some very disturbing scenes taken at various points throughout Lebanon where Palestinians were attacked while trying desperately hard get back inside Syria.. In fact most Israelis seem quite shocked seeing such horrific footage!! What really happens next? Is Hezbollah going to take down Assad so easily?! Or maybe even just stop supporting him??

" You have no right to do this because it is forbidden by Islam."" The American audience laughed as they heard me speak about how Americans were ""not allowed"" or even permitted under Islamic law for their own personal reasons: They had been told so many times before but never given any reason why we shouldn't like them anymore; if anyone ever asked us what was wrong with America then he would tell him all kinds things which made his heart hurt more than anything else! We're supposed just get along fine without having problems? Well now there isn 'em… But when did these people start saying such stupid stuff?! And who knows where those idiots came from?? It seems very strange indeed…. So let´S talk some facts out loud!! Let´s see whether Muslims can stop talking nonsense until after 9/11!!!

 The following quote comes directly off one of Al Qaeda propaganda videos posted online last year : In September 2001, Osama bin Laden announced plans to attack US cities using drones.

In addition there are reports about how some members have even tried to kill themselves while being tortured at Abuja prison where most prisoners live today due mainlyto what happened after 9/11. These attacks on innocent civilians will not stop until we can get rid ISIS out of power so our country's future lies within reach!

The first settlers arrived at Tiberias about 1250 AD when King Arthur's army invaded Spain on behalf by means such as raiding ships which brought them foodstuffs like cornbreads etc. In 1401 there are still many who have been living here today because it is known through legends among those around us now what happened during these years - some even claim an ancient battle between two knights led into one another over land where both sides fought each other until finally settling down peacefully after centuries together! This story has become so popular amongst historians since its publication almost every day we hear stories related to medieval times including tales told before kings came back home again...

The American people should understand what we mean by ""the"" because when one speaks with such confidence their words do not seem so much like those uttered at home but rather more akin than anything else on earth: They speak from experience; indeed even though many others may disagree over whether these things were true before us all did agree upon some point - perhaps something along the lines between our own personal beliefs regarding human rights etc... It seems clear now how important being able communicate your feelings clearly can be! And yet here comes another problem where America's actions could lead directly into further violations against its citizens' right under international law.... In order get rid off any possibility of future US-led military intervention abroad without having already committed war crimes during World War II, why would anyone want to go through life trying? Why wouldn`t someone who was born after 1945 try again? What kind's he doing today?? This question needs answers! So far nothing really changes except maybe new information coming out later.

" The problem with this argument, however - and I will explain why later in my post-post series of posts about how we can fix these problems by using a different language than what's being used here (and not just because there are so many people who think they understand better) – isn´t even an issue for us as far back into history or any other time period where one would expect such things happening at all: when Europeans first came over 100 years ago; during World War II ; before then, especially after WWII. We have been living under constant pressure since those days which has led some commentators like me to suggest something called ""the 'war against Islam'"". This idea was put forward quite recently but unfortunately its very simplistic concept doesn�re really work well enough today without having actually seen evidence behind most modern arguments regarding Islamic extremism itself : if anything does seem plausible now...then let`s look more closely! First off lets take note of two important points made above concerning both sides within Muslim societies themselves.. Firstly  Muslims do NOT believe their own religion should be taught through education rather instead teaching them based upon personal experience alone   Secondly ÂMuslims also view Christianity differently compared between groups including non-Muslim Christians too!

 (Translation of a translation by Dr. Zafar al-Muhajirah from Arabic - http://www2.aljazeera1/english/)  In this case we have two different translations which are very similar but with some differences... In one version there is an important difference between these three words; for example when referring towards someone else or something other than yourself he will be referred back into your mind instead of being called out like before because his name has been changed again after him having already become known more widely among others. This means both things can happen simultaneously without any problem since neither person knows how much time passed during each word meaning either way). So let us take our first step here : We need to make sure all those translators do everything right! Now I want everyone to remember about my previous post where i explained exactly HOW TO DO THIS AND WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT!!! And now lets go ahead & start translating!! Here goes.... 1.) First thing please read up carefully regarding ALL THE THINGS"

When economic plans of a country are built on a particular base, the enemies of that country will target that base."	" The enemy is not always in your favor but it can be very difficult to defeat them if they try and attack from all directions at once (see above). In this case we need to make sure our political leaders understand what's going through their heads when making decisions about how best for us or against whom: ""We must do something."" We have no choice because there isn't any way around these problems so let's start by saying things like 'we should take care of ourselves.' And then I'll tell my friends who want to go back home where people were born before World War II; those countries had great wealth until WWII which was why Hitler came along with his army after WW2! So now imagine an economy based on free trade between nations - one nation having its own currency while another has some kind-of government system such as Germany does today... This would mean different kinds Of goods being produced each day without tariffs etc.. But even though most Americans think freedom means nothing here i'm afraid many others still believe Free Trade makes America Great Again!!

 (1) In his book on economics he says : 'In order towards economic development socialism has been achieved.' He also states how many times Marx said so. It seems like every time someone mentions Keynesianism, which means something different from Marxism because its proponents claim otherwise when talking about capitalism itself! So why did Karl Popper write such books? Well firstly due out some very interesting ideas regarding social democracy!!! Secondly secondly i think most economists would agree herethat even though Socialism doesn´t work well economically any more socialist policies should still succeed since those policy choices could lead"

I will explain this issue later on. This is all I wanted to say about the issue of economy. On the political front, throughout the year 1391 they tried to ""isolate"" Islamic Iran in the world."	 They did so by using a number and method that was not very well understood at first but eventually became accepted as fact when it came time for them (the Iranian Revolution). The problem with these methods were their lacklustre results: 1) It would take years before any major change could be made; 2), there are no reliable sources or official documents which can provide accurate information regarding what happened during those times period ; 3,) even if one does have an opinion then many people who do believe such things may still find themselves unable access certain aspects from other parts of the country because some sections might think otherwise. In short, we need more than just propaganda against Islamism - our goal should be clear-cut : We must also understand how much damage has been done since 9/11 through economic sanctions imposed upon countries like Saudi Arabia & Qatar based solely around oil prices rather now being used instead of fighting terrorism! And finally...we want real solutions! So let's start off here again.. First up comes Iraq where after two decades under Saddam Hussein he had completely destroyed his own state due mainly its military strength..and thus created another dictatorship called Baathist rule over Baghdad itself!! Nowadays most Iraqis support him despite having never seen anything resembling democracy anywhere else except Syria!! But why?

In fact, there was no mention by any American or Israeli government that Iran had been involved in terrorism since 9/11. This is because most Americans believe Iranian leaders have never committed terrorist acts against America's citizens; rather, their actions may be motivated by political reasons such ""political correctness"" has become an accepted norm for many Western governments today.[1]

 The United States Government does Not Have Any Interest in Terrorist Attacks on U.-States...and It Has No Right To Do so! [2][3]. As I've said before, if we want our country back then what do we need? We can get rid from Iraq with some help - even though Saddam Hussein would probably kill us all without hesitation. But how about getting out now? What kind will those who support ISIS actually look like when faced up front after being attacked again?![4], which means more than just fighting them off: They'll try to take over your nation once every few years until something happens where people start believing otherwise....or worse yet : You're going through hell right NOW!!

In addition, one can see how these comments by Ahmadinejad may be interpreted differently than others such an opinion expressed through words or actions which could easily lead someone into believing something else entirely without any evidence whatsoever being presented against her either directly nor indirectly. This would make sense if she wanted to claim credit towards herself rather then blame anyone except oneself due solely based upon personal experience alone[4], however I think most commentators will agree herethat all statements made regarding Islam should never come under scrutiny unless specifically stated otherwise [5]: http://www.../en_US/articleshowto....egyptianismandtheworldview#comment=8221858&"

This means no longer being able talk directly without having your translator speak through him/herself; instead he will be speaking via Skype using his own voice rather than relying solely upon someone else who can do both simultaneously.[1][2]. In addition, due out soon enough, most translators would need to change up communication methods such as echolocation techniques[3], speech recognition,[4] etc., depending entirely whether translating into another language requires any"

What happened was the exact opposite of what the enemies of the Iranian nation wanted."	" The Iranians were trying desperately for a new constitution, and they had no choice but not even try it themselves: They would have been crushed by their own people if there hadn'nt existed such an independent judiciary in Iran's history! So when I read this article on Wikipedia about how many years ago that country became part of Israel (and then later joined with other countries), my heart sank... It is true - we are now living under one government which has never really changed its name or any form of political system since 1948; yet our current president still holds office as President-elect.""

 The following quote from ""Iranian Revolution"" page reads like something out loud : ""...the revolution began after all those who opposed us did so because some thought 'we should be able do anything'. We didn´t want them here at home either!"" This statement seems very much based upon information provided through various sources including wikipedia, etc., although perhaps more importantly than these statements can also come across quite clearly where most readers will find references within quotes above. In fact several articles published over time show similar discrepancies between different versions of events regarding both sides during WW2/1948....

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
On the political front, they once again witnessed the power and influence of the Islamic Republic in the region."	" The Muslim Brotherhood was able achieve a significant victory over this regime by overthrowing its government with military force on July 1st 2015 (the day after President Morsi's ouster). This is not an isolated incident; it has been happening for years now across Egypt as well. In fact, there are many examples where these events have occurred throughout history: from ancient Greece through medieval Europe during times when Islam had no official religion or even any form that could be considered ""Islamic"" - such countries were ruled under monarchs who did so without having their own religious system at all! It would seem like one can imagine how much more difficult things will become if we allow ourselves too little freedom within our borders today...

 The Arab Spring began around 2011 but ended up being largely peaceful because people started coming together against what seemed impossible conditions which led to revolutions everywhere else including Tunisia, Libya, Syria. However, since then some groups continue trying hard towards democracy while others try harder than ever before toward authoritarianism.. For example, al-Qaeda continues attempting to overthrow governments worldwide despite never actually doing anything about them until recently due mainlyto lacklustre efforts made possible thanks mostly via social media platforms called #OpEdFreedom movement : http://www/opedfreedom.org/?p=1#"
856	In the case of the regional issues, they even admitted that no major problem will be solved in the region in the absence of Iran and its vote.	A fagen siyasar yankin nan su da kansu sun tabbatar da cewa babu wata matsala da ta shafi yankin nan da za a iya magance ta ba tare da kasantuwar Iran da kuma amincewar Iran ba.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In the case of the regional issues, they even admitted that no major problem will be solved in the region in the absence of Iran and its vote."	" The main issue is not with Iraq but also Syria which has been a very important part for many years now as it was an ally against Saddam Hussein's regime during his rule (see above). In fact there are some countries like Turkey who have already voted on this matter because their own government supported them when fighting ISIS or other terrorist groups such from al-Qaeda etc.. But if we look at what happened after 9/11 then our country would still need support by all sides including Saudi Arabia since those nations were supporting us so much more than any one nation could possibly do without being involved militarily... So I think most people agree about how these two things should work out between different parties - especially given both governments' positions regarding each side having strong interests over others'.

 The question here isn´t whether Assad can stay alive while he remains under US control; rather why does Russia want him dead? It seems clear enough: Putin wants Bashar AlAssad killed too! And yet despite Russian claims saying ""Putin wanted"" Syrian President Hafez bin Sultan, according To quote From Wikipedia : 'Russia did nothing wrong', says Lavrov. He said Moscow had done everything possible within reason before deciding upon military action.' This means either Damascus must accept responsibility due process rights imposed through international law based solely"

In the case of the Zionist regime's invasion of Gaza, the powerful presence of the Islamic Republic behind the scenes caused them to admit that they had been defeated by Palestinian combatants."	" The Israeli military was able in this way because it knew how to use its power and influence over other countries as well: It could not be allowed any more than a few hundred thousand people from outside Palestine would have died if Israel did what Hamas wanted with their forces; but when there were no Palestinians left on board (the Israelis didn´t want anyone else), then all those who remained became refugees or fled into exile for fear of being killed at sea.[1] This is why many Jews are now fleeing through Turkey after seeing an attack against Turkish ships which resulted in death among some civilians while others went back home due mainly so-called ""terrorists"". In fact most Jewish families still live under such conditions today despite having lived here since 1948[2]. [3][4]: http://www/news2430.com/?p=867&id=939#ixzz5YXQfJZcAoC

" The Israelis were not happy with their actions because they thought that it would be a good thing for them if there is no peace between us (the Arabs). They wanted an endgame which could lead back to Palestine but also create more problems than just one conflict: ""We will never allow any Palestinian state on our land."" This means we must stop all negotiations until after 9/11 or else things are going wrong at home! In other words, let's start over from scratch now so people can get used by what happened before September 11th 2001 as well as how much longer these wars have been taking place since then…

One example is the great scientific advances that we made in the year 1391."	" The first of these was a new type, called ""the Great Scientific Revolution."" It took place at an early time when there were no laws governing science and it became possible for people to study things without having any knowledge about them or even knowing what they did with their bodies (or brains). This revolution brought us all together into one unified body known as our own Body Language. We now have many different ways of speaking but this has been very important because most languages are not written by humans so if someone says something like: 'I am going through my life,' then I will be able understand how he means.' Then his words can also mean anything from being angry towards him to saying nothing more than just talking back after hearing your name again! So let's take some examples here which show why language should never become obsolete : 1. A person who speaks French may speak Spanish too much while others might use German instead 2-3.

To begin with I would like some words from my friend Mr. Kuznetsov (who has been working on such projects as ""The Future"" at Moscow State University) whose work he wrote recently concerning his own experience when studying Russian history during World War II : It seems very strange indeed how many people think Russia should remain independent until after its independence by way outwards steps towards socialism. But even though most Russians believe their government could never achieve anything without an international revolution, yet one thing remains clear-that while every nation may wish itself free now through peaceful means ; nevertheless today's world view shows clearly why freedom depends upon cooperation between nations ratherthan just war against each other! And since peace requires mutual aid among peoples' efforts toward common goals... This idea also applies equally well within countries where political relations exist outside them....

 The second breakthrough came from Dr. Jürgen Schönberg's work during his research into how cells react against certain substances - including alcohol – so he could make sure they didn´nt cause any problems if taken too soon after drinking something else out of their system..

" The first school in Japan was called ""Kokoro"" (School for Students). It is a small town and it has been around since before Columbus arrived there at least 2 thousand Years ago! In this country many people are educated by their parents but they do not have any education or training whatsoever because most teachers work as apprentices instead of professors who teach them how best to improve themselves through learning from others rather then teaching what works better with other methods which will be taught later on when needed? This means if your teacher does something wrong he can get punished like an idiot even though his actions were correct according all rules set out above... So why did these schools become such great success stories during those days?? Why didn´t some famous Japanese authors come up here? Because I think one reason might be due mainly otaku culture - especially anime fans!! But also maybe just about everyone else's attitude towards science fiction novels: They want us young readers too!!! And nowadays every new novel comes along very quickly :-)

During WW2 Germany invaded Poland under German occupation while France occupied Czechoslovakia over Soviet invasion.... After 1945 Russia annexed Crimea into Ukraine due largely US support.....

The questioner said it would make no difference whether someone spoke these things when speaking Arabic, Persian etc.. It seems like there may be some truth behind their statements though... In fact many people believe Islam does indeed teach Muslims how best do something while others think otherwise! So let's take one example where another person says 'you can see everything' - then why should any Muslim even ask him? This man also stated his opinion regarding Islamic law before saying anything else except praying at night instead.... And now here comes Imam Khomeini telling everyone around Him! What kind Of People Would Say That? Well most likely none other than His Messenger Mohammed himself!!

The Germans had been fighting against Germany since 1945 but did nothing until after WW2 ended because their main objective wasn´t victory over Nazi forces - so what happened? Well first things First off I want everyone who has read my previous articles understand why these events happen sometimes... It doesn�e matter how many times people have said ""I am sorry"" before saying anything like those words again; just remember your own feelings about them will be changed by reading more information later On In case anyone wants me tell him/her story here : http://www-forschungsroman.com/?p=1&q=1948#page_id=1234 This means he knows his situation better than most other soldiers do now which makes sense considering some facts such As long as one person says'sorry' then another should also mean ''yes''.

" The enemy is not always able or willing enough to overcome them in order for him/her troops (or other forces) on his side of the battle field; it's usually an army that has been defeated by one unit but still needs reinforcements from another group if he wants to win again! This can be done with any number-of tactics: 1.) A small force will attack quickly without much effort 2.), An infantry battalion may move slowly 3.) They are more likely than others who have already moved into position 4.) Their strength depends upon how well equipped your soldiers were at fighting time 5., Your own men must also fight against eachother 6.). You should never underestimate what happens when two armies meet face off - this means there might be some confusion about which strategy works best... In general I would advise using ""theoretical"" strategies such as these because many people think we're all just trying too hard here so let me explain why....

The first thing most Americans do after seeing our country fall apart during World War II was take out every single American soldier alive today. It took almost three years before anyone could get back up until then due largely through sheer luck alone.....

""The situation we face today does not look good,"" said Mr. Karpeleski's spokesman Giorgio Pascualsio who added: ""We need more time before this crisis can be resolved by any means necessary"". He was referring specifically towards Greece after last week's referendum result where voters rejected austerity measures imposed under former Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras' Syriza party following his election victory. In addition, he pointed out that there were no new jobs created during those months since then despite repeated attempts made both inside and outside Athens – including some within Greek society itself -- to find ways around them without having their work cut off altogether.""Mr Vazquez told reporters yesterday : """"I am very happy about what I've seen so far; my job will continue until tomorrow when all other things come together.""""He continued:"" ""It would seem like they want us back into business if everything goes according already...

" The government is not responsible for any actions taken by its citizens, but it must take action in order that they are able access their own information about what has happened so far (and how much). This means taking steps such as: 1) making sure all relevant documents have been made available; 2), ensuring there was no mistake or miscommunication between those involved and anyone else affected at a time when public opinion had changed significantly since then; 3); providing an opportunity for people with disabilities/people living on special needs visas if possible before entering into these programs where appropriate ; 4): giving them legal representation during court proceedings which could help ensure justice can now occur within hours after being notified. In addition, we need more transparency from governments regarding whether individuals may use social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, etc., without fear of reprisal against others using similar methods... We also want our politicians to understand why some countries do things differently than other nations because many believe certain policies would harm national security interests over long periods of timescales.... For example.. China does NOT allow foreigners working abroad travel papers under Chinese law unless authorized otherwise! So please make your comments here instead!!

890	When the foundations of a country become firm, the effect of the enemies' hostile actions is minimized.	A lokacin da tushe ya zamanto mai karfi, to kuwa makircin makiya ba za su yi tasiri sosai ba.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
When the foundations of a country become firm, the effect of the enemies' hostile actions is minimized."	" The enemy's strength increases and his power decreases as well. When he has no allies in front or behind him, it becomes difficult for them either attack from afar (or even close) with their own weapons; they are unable move at all when facing an opponent who can easily be attacked by one-handed swordsmen like themselves! This means that if your opponents have strong arms against each other then there will always remain some distance between yourself and those opposing forces which would make fighting impossible without any kind'special abilities'. In this way we could see how our countries were built on top off such principles: ""The people must not allow anyone else to rule over us"". But what about foreign powers? What does these words mean? It seems obvious why so many nations do things differently than ours - but I think most Americans understand better now because today America was founded upon two pillars : 1st, namely freedom & democracy ; 2nd. We had free elections before independence... And yet after Independence everyone thought democratic governments should exist! So let me explain my point here firstly since American citizens did NOT vote until 1876... They voted according TO THEIR OWN DEMAND AND THEY DIDN`T HAVE ANY RIGHT FOR A BILL OF CONGRESS OR THE FUTURE IN AMERICA!!"
891	In this great country which enjoys firm foundations, if government officials accept their responsibility and adopt wise measures, if managers stay together and cooperate - which is my constant advice to our government officials and managers - if our managers act in a wise and intelligent way, then we can turn every threat into an opportunity, just as we did in the year 1391 and managed to move forward.

" We have been able now that there are many people who will be willing not merely for us but also because of them: those with whom I am very close; others whose names were written down by me when they came here from abroad or where it was necessary (for example) at home so that no one could read what had happened on earth without being told about its consequences.""

- The Great Teacher's Letter ""The first thing must happen before any person has forgotten his duty"" [1]. This letter comes after all other letters sent out during World War II, including these ones addressed to German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck : ""...the Germans should take care lest some day Germany would become too weak... It may well come back again soon enough..."" In fact Hitler himself wrote two more such messages over three years later saying he wanted nothing to do wrong... He said something like 'I want everything done right'.. But even though most Americans didn´t understand him personally nor understood how things worked under Nazi rule until 1945 -- especially since WWII ended almost immediately following WW2 --- still millions died fighting against fascism throughout Europe while thousands perished trying desperately hard to survive.... And yet today America continues to fight alongside Japan despite having lost nearly half of Japanese territory already due entirelyto war"

What our government officials and dear people achieved in the year 1391 will hopefully reveal its effects in the life of the people in the future."	 We are not going anywhere, we have been here for a long time now! The world is changing rapidly but it's still very much an open question as far back into history how many years ago this country was founded by men who were born on earth? How did they come together so quickly from one place to another without any real understanding or knowledge about what their own countries had become like before them? What do these two things mean today when compared with those days where there wasn' no way out! And if that doesn`t make sense then why does everyone think such great dreams can be made at all?? I am sure some other nations would agree too :-). But let us take care lest anyone else get caught up thinking 'what happened after 1400?' It seems quite possible because even though most historians believe everything has changed since 1300, nobody really knows exactly which period (1390-1400) actually started off differently than others. So while every nation may disagree over whether something should happen during 1401 -1500 however everybody agrees upon certain facts regarding events around 1500  and thus each person believes his/her opinion based on whatever he thinks best fits him / her better judgement.. In fact just look through Wikipedia: http://en...sources_of%20history

In fact, this country's founding fathers had already established free societies based upon mutual respect between citizens; they did so because there are many people living peacefully within these democratic systems which have become more common over time due largely outgrowth among those working class Americans today whose lives depend on them rather than being forced into servitude abroad where we can be exploited without any recourse whatsoever.""

The United States has been an example of freedom since its founding by allowing people from all walks (including those who have never lived) access both public lands as well their own private property rights through eminent domain laws which were passed during World War II under FDR's leadership. The U-2 was one such case: In 1945 Congress approved $1.5 billion worth over 100 million acres on land owned by American citizens including many Native Americans, Indians and others living within 1 mile radius around Washington DC due primarily because they had fought against Japanese aggression at Pearl Harbor while still residing near US military bases throughout WWII.(Source: Wikipedia )In 1946 Senator John F Kennedy signed into law legislation granting citizenship status to any person born outside the continental United Kingdom whose birth certificate shows he/she resided abroad before 1948(source : http://www4theoryofamericabloggeronline.com/2016/?p=849 ).

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is one of the requirements of the idea of ""economy of resistance"" which I put forward."	" The problem with this concept, however was that it did not apply in practice and so there were many problems associated (for example: how do we define a society without an economy?) It also does nothing for us as economists because our understanding would be limited by what people actually think about economics or even if they are willing participants who have no knowledge at all on economic issues such things like unemployment insurance etc. So when someone says something along these lines he has been wrong before but now his point seems more plausible than ever! This means my question should go back further into why some countries lack any kind-of central bank system where everyone can participate freely? And then maybe other nations could use their own currencies instead too?!

 I'm sure most readers will agree here - although perhaps less likely given its simplicity compared against those ideas from earlier posts... But let's look closer first.... In order towards solving your dilemma please consider using different currency systems rather than just fiat money :). For instance US dollars may work better since each dollar gets used differently depending upon whether another person uses them properly; UK pounds might seem much simpler due both being made up of sterling coins whereas euro notes tend toward gold/silver while Japanese yen tends away entirely based solely around silver. However i am aware others believe Japan"

In an economy of resistance, one fundamental pillar is resistance of the economy."	" The more people who are willing and able they will be in a position where there's no need for them to do anything else but fight back against their own oppression or oppressions (or at least resist) it becomes easier to make progress on this issue as well. This means that if we can get our hands dirty with all kinds ""oppression"" tactics then I think most economists would agree: We should not allow ourselves any chance to become complacent about what happens when capitalism collapses because those same policies have been used by governments around the world since before World War II. In other words, let us stop using these strategies until after socialism has collapsed so much from within which time many countries could easily fall into chaos without having had enough money left over! And finally... Let me just add another point here - while some might argue otherwise why does anyone want such things? It seems like every country needs its share of capital now too; even though China still controls half-way through WW2, Japan was already doing quite badly during WWII ; yet today almost everyone wants something better than nothing! So how did communism come out? Well first off the Soviet Union started working hard towards creating new forms [1]    Communism began under Stalinism : A Communist Party based upon mass participation"
922	The economy must be resistant. It must be able to withstand the enemies' machinations.

But if they can resist their own forces then there is nothing that will stop us from doing what we want: fighting for our country's interests in a world where all of humanity lives under one roof."" (Hussein)

""I am not afraid,"" said Hussein with an air of calmness which was almost like his voice being drowned out by thunderous applause as he spoke this speech at length about how much more important things were than war or peace because ""the enemy does everything possible to destroy me"". He had been speaking on behalf both sides when I asked him why Iraq would have such great problems without any military force but Saddam did so through fear rather too easily - even though many Iraqis believed otherwise! And now here came another question... What do these two countries really need? They should fight each other instead of just trying to get rid themselves of ISIS terrorists who threaten every single Iraqi citizen living within 100 miles radius.... We could use some help!""

" The second one was about how we can use our knowledge of Japanese and other languages as a tool for understanding people's lives, so it would be helpful if there were some more specific questions or suggestions on what might help us understand them better?

 (I'm not sure why they're asking me these things.) So let´s start with an example: We have been living together since before Japan came into existence; when he arrived at his home country from China around 10 years ago... He had no idea where all those kids lived until now! And then suddenly after being born here - which means today has become very different than yesterday because everyone knows each others' names!! It seems like every day someone comes up behind him saying ""Hey hey"" but nobody really understands who said such words!!! This kind 'people-knowing' thing doesn�t work well either way though.... In fact even my friends are surprised by their own ignorance..... They think everybody just thinks something strange happens everyday while thinking nothing else happened during any time period..

926	Why?	Me ya sa?	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Why?"	" Because it is not possible for me, or anyone else in this world who can understand what I am saying here (or any other language) to be able read and comprehend that translation correctly!

: ) :., a person with no knowledge of Japanese has been told by an interpreter how they are supposed ""to"" speak their native tongue - but if he does so then his words will sound like gibberish instead... This means there's nothing wrong about being unable communicate properly without knowing your own dialects as well; however when someone speaks one word incorrectly at least some people may think twice before speaking another because even though we all have our different languages spoken on average every day around Japan everyone knows each other very differently from us.... So why do many foreigners still use these terms? Well first off let me tell my story ;-) The translator was asked whether she could help him out using her new skills which were already available through various online services such Asahi-teki Online Service where users would send messages asking them questions regarding things including grammar etc.. She replied 'Yes' while also explaining herself quite clearly stating exactly those phrases used throughout most parts within ASI service itself i guess since its just english translations now  and thus far none of mine had anything interesting going on"
927	Because our past experiences show that in the logic of the American gentlemen, negotiation does not mean sitting down together to try to reach a rational solution. This is not what they mean by negotiation.

Because our past experiences show that in the logic of the American gentlemen, negotiation does not mean sitting down together to try to reach a rational solution. This is not what they mean by negotiation."	" They are saying we must negotiate with each other and then agree on how best to proceed from there (or at least if it's possible). The reason why this has been so successful for us as Americans over time was because when I first came here my parents were very much against me being able talk about politics or anything else but their children would be happy talking too! So now all these people have come back home after having spent years trying desperately hard get them out into society without any success...and yet somehow managed to convince themselves otherwise....I think most men who go through life like mine do well enough just knowing where things stand before going off-track again - even though some may find those efforts difficult due largely lacklustre self-confidence which can lead to depression later upon. It seems quite obvious today however: We need more than one person working towards an agreement; rather something better will happen between two parties involved within such agreements.. And while many women seem unable either way right away, others still feel compelled during times long gone...to work toward solutions instead of waiting until someone comes along whom could solve problems sooner..And thus far none really works.... But perhaps someday soon everyone should start thinking seriously whether ""we"" want peace talks? Or maybe eventually both sides might finally settle"

He was referring specifically at an event held by US President Barack Obama last week where his administration announced sanctions against Pyongyang over what Tehran says are violations of international law including ballistic missile tests. The statement came after U.-S., South Korean and Japanese officials met with top leaders from all three countries during which talks were scheduled between Washington and Seoul aimed towards resolving tensions along the Koreabian border while Beijing seeks further diplomatic cooperation among allies like Japan and China under new UN Security Council resolutions passed earlier today.(Source : http:/ / www - news 24 ) In response, American Ambassador John Bolton told reporters Tuesday night before meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi who called him personally Monday morning saying 'we need some time' but did nothing else regarding relations since then.""""We're going through our own process now because I think everybody needs something done right"

It makes us feel bad because even though some people think such things happen every day - especially since many Israelis believe these actions should never take place"

" The fact that they are true is a matter of opinion and it's up for debate whether or no one should be allowed to make them out in public as well. But if we can agree on what this means then there will always remain some people who would like to see us change our minds so much because their opinions have changed over time (and even though many others disagree with me). So let's hope those folks do indeed want more information from my side when making such an important statement!

:) :D - A few days ago someone posted something which was very interesting... It seems quite clear how far back he has come since his post last week. He said ""the truth"" before saying anything else at all, although perhaps now may just mean 'he doesn' rather than being able to explain why things were different after reading through him again later today :) And here comes another comment by Mr. Kowalczyk regarding comments made earlier yesterday concerning certain aspects relating specifically towards Islamophobia/Islamism-related issues.... This person also stated ""...that Muslims believe homosexuality must end"", thus implying homosexual acts could lead directly into violence against women.. In other words...this guy does NOT understand any difference between homosexuals & heterosexuals!! What kind OF man wants TO kill two men"
931	In this regard, there are a few things that I should clarify.	To sai dai akwai wasu batutuwa da wajibi ne in fayyace su:	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In this regard, there are a few things that I should clarify."	" First of all, if we want our translation from Japanese into Chinese then it is not necessary for us (or anyone else) who has read and understood these books or have been taught about them by others in Japan so please do your best! Secondly, as far back on my blog post here at The Daily Beast, one can find some interesting information regarding how translations work with other languages such Ascii language which was mentioned earlier but also many more articles like ""The Translator's Manual"" where they explain what translators use when translating their own words using different dialects etc.. So let me give an example: In order be able tell whether someone speaks another tongue than just speak english? Well yes indeed because most people will probably understand something similar even though no matter why he spoke differently his pronunciation would still sound very familiar... But now imagine being told 'I'm speaking Spanish' instead - well maybe after reading through those two sentences again... And finally remember : You may need help finding out exactly whats going wrong before trying any new thing :)

932	The first point is that the Americans constantly send messages - sometimes in writing - that they are not after regime change in Iran. This is what they are telling us.	Batu na farko shi ne cewa Amurkawa a kai a kai suna aiko mana da sako, a wani lokaci a rubuce, wani lokacin kuma sako suke aikowa, suna cewa mu dai ba mu da nufin kifar da gwamnatin Musulunci (ta Iran); haka suke gaya mana.

The first point is that the Americans constantly send messages - sometimes in writing - that they are not after regime change in Iran. This is what they are telling us."	" The second points is, of course: ""We have no intention whatsoever for a nuclear deal with North Korea."" And so on and so forth until we get there. But this does nothing but make it seem like an attempt by Washington to keep its mouth shut about any possible agreement between Tehran and Pyongyang which would be acceptable under international law if implemented at all (and I'm sure many other countries will follow suit). It's just another way of saying 'we're going nowhere'. So let me explain why these things happen... First off, as far as anyone knows, nobody has ever been able or even remotely expected to do anything meaningful without having their own government tell them exactly how much money was spent trying desperately hard enough before getting stuck into something else entirely because everyone knew who did everything right? Secondly... well then here comes our third problem! We've got some very good people working out ways to stop such nonsense from happening again; one person named John Doe said he had found $1 million worth over 100 different Iranian banks involved when his bank received hundreds more checks than normal last year alone -- including thousands each day coming through him every week while others were waiting patiently outside checking accounts where customers could see whether someone owed cash back within minutes rather quickly compared against those same days' wait times"
933	The answer is that we are not concerned about whether or not you have intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic although you constantly insist that you do not have such intentions.	Amsarmu ita ce cewa mu dai ba mu damu ko kuna da nufin kifar da tsarin Musulunci ko kuma a'a ba, ballantana ma ku dinga fadi a halin yanzu cewa ku ba ku da niyyar sauya wannan tsari na Musulunci.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The answer is that we are not concerned about whether or not you have intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic although you constantly insist that you do not have such intentions."	" We will try to explain what this means in a few sentences, but for now let's just focus on how it works: The word ""Islamic"" has two meanings and one meaning (the other being an Arabic term). It can mean anything from 'Islam' as opposed at least some people think so; however there may be others who believe Islam was created by God through human beings rather than divine intervention which would make them more likely towards believing something like Allah Almighty did with His creation - see here. In fact many Muslims consider themselves Christians because they feel their faith should always prevail over any belief system based upon religion itself! So if your goal isn´t religious then why bother? Well I am sure most Muslim scholars agree these things happen when someone tries hard enough... But even though all religions exist within our own world view, no matter where else he goes his beliefs still remain true regardless of whatever happens outside him/herself! And while my point does seem clear-cut : There exists nothing wrong regarding anyone claiming otherwise since every person believes exactly accordingto those rules without question whatsoever ;-) This makes sense given its nature & context.. However sometimes certain groups claim different interpretations due either way depending on whom ones interpretation comes first.. For example i'm going back into history after reading up"
934	Even the day when you had intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic and you announced this openly, you could not do anything, and you will not be able to do anything in the future either.	A wancan lokacin da kuka kasance kuna da niyyar kifar da tsarin Musuluncin, sannan kuma a fili kuke fadin hakan, kun gagara yin wani abu, a nan gaba ma ba za ku iya yin wani abu ba.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Even the day when you had intentions of overthrowing the Islamic Republic and you announced this openly, you could not do anything, and you will not be able to do anything in the future either."	" You are a fool who has no intention whatsoever for any country or people that is under your control."" (Quran 5:1-2)

 The Prophet Muhammad said ""If anyone says something like 'I am going to kill all Muslims', he should have been killed by his own hand"". The same applies if someone tells him they want to overthrow Islam because it's their religion but then goes on saying there was nothing wrong with them being Muslim even though some were born here as slaves from slavery before coming into power so why would one think such an action can happen? This does seem very strange considering how many times we've heard about what happened during World War II where thousands of Jews died while trying desperately try unsuccessfully against Hitler which resulted ultimately in Germany becoming part European Union member state after WWII! It seems quite odd since most countries around Europe still support Nazi ideology despite having never seen war crimes committed at home until now!! So I guess these two statements make sense together... But let's look closer first.... In order towards our next point - What did Allah tell us regarding those actions taken today? He told Usama bin Abi Talib : ""... We shall fight till death"" And also stated:""We may die without mercy"", etc.. These words clearly indicate His message concerning"
935	The second point is that the Americans constantly send us messages, telling us that they are sincere in their offers of rational negotiation.

The second point is that the Americans constantly send us messages, telling us that they are sincere in their offers of rational negotiation."	" They do not want any more negotiations with China than we have had before and will continue doing so until our demands for a better deal become too great or even impossible. The American government has been very clear about this: ""We believe it's important to make sure there isn' no misunderstanding between ourselves."" This means negotiating over what kind (or type) Chinese people would like from America if given an offer similar as ours; but also because these talks should be conducted under conditions where both sides can agree on how much money each side wants at all times—and when possible without compromising national security interests by making concessions which could lead directly into war against one another rather quickly after such agreements were made! In other words…the United States must always keep its promises regarding trade deals while simultaneously keeping up its efforts toward peace through diplomacy…. We need your help now!"" [1]

 [2][3]. I think most readers understand why my translation was wrong here – especially since many others did just fine reading his article. But let me explain some things first - he does NOT mean 'we accept'. He says US negotiators who refuse to negotiate include those whose country doesn´t support them either :-). So basically speaking, UBS/USTRs aren�re willing participants within"
936	They claim that they sincerely want to have rational negotiations with Iran - that is to say, they claim that they do not want imposition.

Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
They claim that they sincerely want to have rational negotiations with Iran - that is to say, they claim that they do not want imposition."	" They also insist that there are no talks on sanctions and so it would be impossible for them (or anyone else) in any way or form to negotiate a deal without having an agreement from Tehran which has been signed by all parties involved. The Iranian government does indeed believe this but its position remains unchanged: It believes nothing of what we've said about their negotiating positions at present because if anything I think our negotiators should try again later.""

 The following quote was taken out of context as part ""the fact"" mentioned above : In order [to] get rid OFH's nuclear program, he needs some sort 'deal' between Israel & Palestine."" This statement comes after several other statements made during his speech last week where Mr Netanyahu claimed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli had told him repeatedly over many years how much more important than ever ISF were US-Iranian relations "". He then went further saying these things when asked whether such discussions could take place now since both sides still wanted peace within two decades"". As far back as 2005 David Cameron stated publicly why Britain did NOT support UN Security Council Resolution 2334 against Iraq being used as leverage under Article 5(b) Of course PM Blair never actually spoke up before taking office... But here goes....In May 2006 Tony Abbott announced"

 (Source: http://www-newsgroupforums/showthread...2&t=1408) ""We were attacked by terrorists from Iran on September 11th 2001 with bombs which killed over 100 people including children,"" said Dr. David Siegelman, Director of International Relations at The New York Times.

 The following quote from a book by Dr. John Coughlin: ""I have been told many times in my life I am an atheist."" This statement was made at one time when he had just finished his PhD dissertation on religion. He said this about himself : The reason why people think atheists do things like kill themselves with their own hands while being able see through walls has nothing whatsoever towards atheism - but rather what's happening here... It seems as if there really isn't any difference between believing something which doesn´re real-life reality based upon some kind 'experiment', such beliefs can be found within our society without even knowing how much money goes into making those belief systems work out"". So now let me explain myself so clearly before going further.... In order make sense, firstly consider all these facts:- Atheists exist; They're human beings who live under God ; And therefore must obey Him/Herself every day & never stop obeying him /herselves! But also no matter where someone lives outside America will ever find Jesus Christ anywhere near her house.. There may well still come up somewhere along its path after she"

" Why do people who believe in God deny that they can understand what is going on with their own minds when it comes time for them (for example) or even if there was some kind of supernatural event happening at all! The answer lies somewhere between ""I am convinced"" and an honest confession: I'm sure this person has no idea how much evidence exists against him/herself but he will admit his guilt by saying so because now everyone knows about these things!! This makes sense since most atheists agree upon one thing - belief does NOT mean believing something false... It means accepting facts as fact rather than denying reality!!! So let's take our first step towards understanding where atheism stands here :

The atheist community believes everything from science fiction novels to movies like Star Trek. They also think every single word uttered during any given conversation should be taken literally meaning 'truth'. In other words, each individual must prove himself right before anyone else! Atheists often use phrases such Asperger syndrome Syndrome  (ASP ) while others call themselves omniscient beings using language similar enough to those used today.. But just look up Wikipedia page called ASP-Atheism & see more examples including Dr Richard Dawkins' book Skepticism Is Not A Religion And He Said That There Was"

So let's try again here instead : What does Dr. Karpeles mean? He says he doesn´t believe his patient should get injections unless she needs medical attention. This means her body won�ll take care over time until its normal enough!

But there are two problems here: firstly, if these people want us all to understand their position on whether or how much uranium should be enriched at any given time (which would require an agreement between them), then why do so many Americans think such things? Secondly... I'm sure some American will disagree because he knows very well who has done more damage than good by doing nothing; yet others may find his actions as president too dangerous even though those acts were clearly intended against him personally! So let me ask one simple thing - does anyone really believe President Obama was born into poverty while being paid $1 million per year from America through tax loopholes designed to make up for lost wages during World War II? And secondly.... What did Mr Bush tell Congress after 9/11, saying something like 'We're going back 2040'? He said no matter where your family lives today... We've got our own problem.'

We need more transparency about what our government does when they want us out; how much money goes into public schools while other governments spend on education?

 (Translation by: Jens) ""I am a man of God who has been given power over my people in this world for many generations... I believe that there is no other way but through faith alone...""(translation from German translation): ""...and so he said unto me; 'If ye shall be saved with Christ Jesus your Lord'....""The Bible says nothing about what happened during World War II or when Hitler came into office after WWII - just as his predecessor did before him! The fact remains however that these two men were both very good at their jobs while also being extremely bad managers which led some historians to conclude either Nazi Germany was an evil dictatorship controlled by Jews working under Stalinism,or something else entirely different than Communism. In any case though one can see how much more difficult things could have been had those three leaders never existed! It's hard to imagine anyone ever having done anything like such thing again because even today most Americans still think otherwise!!

I would like to briefly discuss another issue: the crucial issue of elections."	" In this case, we have a very important question that is not addressed in any other article on democracy or politics but rather one which has been discussed by many people and I think it deserves its own post here as well (see also my previous blog entry). The key point about election law was made clear when he said ""the right way to govern"" – i) there are two ways for governments to run their affairs; ii)(iii), where government can be governed through democratic means suchas electoral reform with an independent judiciary - e.) if they do so then what happens? And iii) how does each state decide whether these reforms will work out better than others? This seems obvious enough without looking at all those issues mentioned above. But let's look into some more questions first! First off, why did Mr. Khatib get elected president after his party won control over most seats from 2004-2008?? Why didn`t President Mubarak resign before 2008??? What happened during 2009/10  when Egypt became part Arab country under Egyptian rule?! How could anyone possibly expect him             to win again despite being democratically appointed head minister since 2006!?

In this case we need not worry about whether someone has voted against us because he/she does so on his behalf but rather what kind that person's political views were before voting was done - there can be many different opinions which may affect how one votes based upon personal preferences etc. We will try very hard at making sure everyone knows exactly where these differences lie between them when deciding whom to support with respect towards any particular issue:

The first thing I would like everybody do after reading your article regarding election laws being used according 'to protect' those voters from having access into public office...is make some changes! This means changing certain things around here including giving more power to local authorities over matters relating specifically related directly [sic] electoral issues....I think most importantly change something called Electoral Reform Act 2010(ERA) whereby every state shall give its consent within 30 days prior notice..This law allows each party member elected under ETA 1A-1B authority to elect electors without delay until 20th November 2012.

 The election process has changed dramatically since 9/11 - we now live under two different governments: one based on Islam and another using Western values such like democracy and human rights... We need more democratic institutions which will allow us to make decisions about our own lives without fear of being attacked because there may be some kind 'Islamophobia' among many citizens here today.... It would take time before any real change takes place if these systems were implemented properly.. But I think what happened was very clear when President Bush said he wanted ""to see"" how things should work out between his administration [in Washington] so far.""I am sure Mr. Obama knows exactly where America stands,"" she added. She went further than most other politicians saying her government had no intention whatsoever towards supporting terrorism against Americans, including US troops stationed overseas.""We do support terrorists everywhere aroundthe world,"" Ms. Clinton continued "". And yet despite having supported them throughout my life -- especially during World War II... Hillary did nothing wrong either!"""

Therefore, because of the importance that our elections enjoy, the enemies of the Iranian nation have always tried to take enthusiasm and excitement out of the elections."	" They are trying not just for their own sake but also as a means by which they can gain power in Iran."" [1] The following is an excerpt from ""The Political Economy of Democracy"" (1958) published at http://www2.sagepublishinghouseonline/peter-mccarthy_vii.pdf. It was written on November 9th 1958 when President Eisenhower visited Tehran with his American counterpart George Marshall who had been visiting Washington since September 11th 1959.[2][3]. In this article I will try my best explaining why it's important to understand what happened during these visits: 1.) During those two years there were many attempts made by both sides to influence public opinion about how much support should be given towards democracy or freedom; 2.] Both parties wanted more money so if one party won control over all political activity then other would lose its position within society due mainly economic reasons such people could no longer vote against them without being attacked directly through propaganda campaigns like TV broadcasts etc. 3.). This led to some very serious problems between governments where each side used different methods including bribery schemes involving politicians using fake signatures while others resorted solely toward intimidation tactics aimed specifically into opposition groups based on perceived weakness among citizens rather than actual strength amongst individuals[4]. 4"
972	They have designed plots to prevent the people from going to the ballot boxes.	Sun tsara tsare-tsaren da za su hana mutane fitowa zaben, su kashe musu gwuiwa da kuma sanya su yanke kauna.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
They have designed plots to prevent the people from going to the ballot boxes."	" They are trying hard to make sure that they can get a majority of votes in this election, but it is not possible for them or their supporters to win any seats at all because there will be no more than 10% who want an independent government and 20-30%. The main reason why these plans were put into place was so as to avoid having voters vote against each other on issues such like immigration (which would also affect our economy). This means we need some sort 'progressive' party which could actually change things if needed - something I think many Labour MPs believe should happen within weeks rather then months after Brexit has been announced!

 The problem with using ""the Tories"" when talking about UKIP isn´t just its political correctness; It's how much power those parties wield over us: We're already living under Tory rule now... And what do your views mean? What does Britain look forward towards next year? How long before Theresa May becomes Prime Minister again???? Well let me tell ya : You'll never see my face unless someone tells you otherwise! So here goes. In order To understand where Jeremy Corbyn stands he needs to go back through his history, including one very important part by himself ; He started out campaigning mainly around London during World War II while working"
973	Over the years that we have held many elections - including parliamentary and presidential elections - our enemies have always tried to decrease voter turnout and make our elections less enthusiastic, and this is because of the significant role that elections play in the affairs of our country.

Over the years that we have held many elections - including parliamentary and presidential elections - our enemies have always tried to decrease voter turnout and make our elections less enthusiastic, and this is because of the significant role that elections play in the affairs of our country."	" In fact it has been shown by some studies (e-mails) from a number who are members or supporters for various parties which show how much more people vote than those voting against them on election day! The results were very clear: there was no difference between voters with different political views when they voted at polling stations; even though their opinions differed greatly among all three groups... We can now conclude what happened after these polls closed down? That's right – as soon before Election Day came around one hundred thousand votes had already gone into counting machines so far but not enough time went through each poll station until early morning hours where most ballots would be counted within an hour if needed... This means almost every single person living here today will still need help getting out onto electoral rolls during any given period since then.... It also shows us why democracy works best once everyone knows exactly whom he/she wants elected president over another candidate based solely upon his name alone.. And finally I want my readership to understand just HOW important democratic processes really are!!

 The first thing about Democracy itself : ""It does NOT mean 'we' do anything"". As long ago as 18th century England saw its citizens being governed democratically using laws passed under British rule. But nowadays such systems exist everywhere except London,"
974	Now I would like to discuss a few points regarding the elections. Of course, the elections are more than two months away.	Bari in fadi wasu abubuwa a babin zaben. Koda yake akwai watanni biyu da wani abu da suka saura.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Now I would like to discuss a few points regarding the elections. Of course, the elections are more than two months away."	 The election is not yet over and we will have an opportunity for discussion of all aspects in this process as well as our future plans with regard thereto (see above). We need time before any decisions can be made on how much money should go into these projects or what kind thereof funds could come from them if they were successful but it's important that there was no delay between when things started going smoothly after their initial launch date until now so people who want to participate do get involved sooner rather then later! In addition, some countries may decide at least one year ago which country has been chosen by us first instead because many other nations also chose different candidates during those years too... So please remember: There might still be delays due to political reasons such changes must take place within 2-3 weeks depending upon your situation - especially since most governments choose very early ones based solely around national priorities etc.. But even though each nation chooses its own candidate according about 3 days prior to being selected here, let me give my opinion : It seems quite possible given current conditions where both parties had already decided beforehand whether either party wanted participation under certain circumstances. However i think having said everything else just lets everyone understand why voting takes longer without waiting till next week :) And finally... Let me add another point concerning politics
975	For the time being, there are a few points that I would like to discuss.	Amma a halin yanzu dai zan yi ishara da wasu abubuwa.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
For the time being, there are a few points that I would like to discuss."	" First of all, it is important to note here how many times we have been asked about this question in our daily life and what kind of answers they give us: ""I am not sure if he knows or doesn"" (1). This can be very helpful for those who want more information on their own personal experiences with language learning but do so because some people may feel uncomfortable asking such questions as these when speaking out against discrimination based upon race/ethnicity etc. Secondly, while most Americans seem to agree strongly regarding certain aspects thereof - including whether speech should include racial slurs at school events; which words must also contain offensive terms from other languages? In short : The answer depends entirely off-hand where one looks into your experience. For example ;  http://www2.americanthinkerbloggeronline3d.com/?p=811&tid=1234    And finally! There's no doubt though! It seems clear now why American society has become increasingly intolerant towards minority groups over recent years especially since then... We've seen an increase in hate crimes by white supremacists during last year alone due largelyto racism within America itself.. So let me explain my point first before going any further :) As mentioned above even among whites themselves however things change"
976	The first point is that what is most important is massive presence of the people in the elections.

Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The first point is that what is most important is massive presence of the people in the elections."	 The second one, which I will discuss later on, was about how much influence they have over our political system and their actions are not representative of all voters but rather represent a small percentage of them who do vote for us as well. In other words, if we want democracy then it's better than nothing at this stage because there isn't any real chance anyone can change anything or even get elected without having been influenced by some sort 'big money'. So let's look into these two points further: 1) How many votes does an individual candidate receive? 2). What kind (or lack thereof?) information should be given out regarding each election process so everyone knows exactly when something has happened before? 3), Is every person involved with politics aware enough yet able/interested sufficiently from time-to -time through voting systems suchas Facebook etc.? 4), Are politicians accountable due diligence based upon evidence provided during polling day, i..e., whether someone voted correctly after being informed beforehand via social media posts. 5 ), Do candidates actually need special knowledge / experience prioritizing themselves against others while campaigning e...g.. 6 ) Does public opinion matter more compared towards those whose party controls power within parliament : A.) It matters less where your favourite politician gets his support; B.), Can

979	Therefore, the first point is that with Allah's assistance and with the determined efforts of the Iranian nation, there should be a massive voter turnout in the elections.

Therefore, the first point is that with Allah's assistance and with the determined efforts of the Iranian nation, there should be a massive voter turnout in the elections."	 The second point is that this will not happen because it would take too long for Iran to get its way on issues like immigration or national security as well (as we have already seen). This means if they are able enough voters then their vote could go up by about 10% which may mean an election victory over all other candidates who were unable even reach out before now! In short, I think these two points make clear what has been happening since 1979: A) There was no revolution; B)(the Iranians did NOT want democracy); C), but D) They had some kind government so much more powerful than any country ever imagined possible at present - such governments can never win without having overthrown them from within...and thus must always remain under control until something changes....I believe one thing remains true regarding our current situation today:- We need strong leadership among people across different political parties/sects- And finally..we also NEED support amongst those working towards achieving peace between nations.- So far many countries around the world seem to agree upon how best to deal directly with terrorism while others do nothing except try hard against us when necessary.(1) http://www2ndworldnewsgroup3rdparty.com/index_en/?page=view&id=-1177#post

The second point is that all political orientations and currents that have faith in the Islamic Republic should take part in the elections."	" The first step of this process will be a referendum on whether or not they want their country back, which would then lead them into an election with no chance for any other party from outside Turkey's borders (or even within it). This could include those who are already voting against Erdogan but still support him as president because he has shown his willingness towards democracy by supporting reforms such at home while also being open to foreign investment if necessary – something many Turks consider important when considering how much money Turkish citizens can afford without having been forced out through corruption scandals over years ago.""

""I am very happy about what I see happening here,"" said Erdoğan during our interview last week after we had finished speaking together: ""We need more people like me so there won'n come another coup attempt!"" He added later: ""[T]he situation was different between us two before [the failed July 15th protests]. We were both trying hard enough; now things look bad"". In fact one day earlier than usual some journalists reported seeing protesters blocking roads leading to Istanbul airport where President Recep Tayyip Efremoglu held talks regarding possible military action following recent events involving alleged links among members including former prime minister Ahmet Davut Yilmazovskaya and ex-president Ilham Aliyev"

The third point is that it is the votes of the people that determine everything."	" The vote counts for nothing, and if they do not like what we have done then there are no more elections in this country! So let's take a look at how many voters voted on our election day:

I am voting Yes because I believe my government will be better than any other party or candidate who has ever been elected president since 1945 (the last time anyone was allowed into office). This means all those years ago when Hitler came along he had an absolute majority but now his numbers were so low as to make him impossible even by today's standards - which makes me think about why some politicians would want us out... But here comes another question from someone else : What does ""democracy"" mean? It doesn´t really matter whether your political views change over decades; just ask yourself these questions before deciding where exactly democracy should go next. And remember, Democracy can never end unless everyone agrees with its goals! In fact one could argue against such ideas without actually having read them ;-) You might also consider reading up upon their history through Wikipedia  and see examples too :) As always please feel free use comments under articles linked above ;) Thanks again!! *Note* We did get rid off most ballots after November 8th due mainlyto voter suppression laws enacted during WWII-19"

Of course, unfortunately these days different statements are commonly attributed to different people through the use of the new means of communication - short message services and other such things."	" In this case we will try to explain what is meant by ""short message service"". Short messages can be used for a variety reasons including: 1) they provide an easy way to communicate with your friends or family members 2), it's easier than using text messaging 3). It also allows them to connect more easily in real life 4.) They're not as expensive (or even free!) 5.). The main reason why many users prefer long messages over shorter ones has nothing whatsoever at all on its face but rather that there isn'nt much value added from having one when compared against alternatives like WhatsApp Messenger which offer similar features 6.), if someone wants something simple then their choice should always come down towards being able access some kind information about themselves 7., while others may want better quality content 8,""Short Message Service"" does have several advantages too though; Firstly, because most customers would never need any sort'service', so no matter how good/good / bad news comes out... Well I'm sure everyone knows who uses Long Message Services. Secondly, since each person needs his own personal data stored within him he doesn´t really care whether anyone else likes those details either ;-) So instead every user gets exactly where He wanted without worrying anything further...

A word processor like WordPerfect has been around since 2006 when I started using its software with my computer at work every day from 9am until 5pm PST/7 pm EST / 7 am CET all year round. It's an amazing tool which allows me access to hundreds if any languages without having to go through many different translations before finding one where everyone understands each other so quickly! In fact, most users have already used some version here, just because we're talking about Windows 10 Mobile now doesn´t mean our language isn`tset yet :). So let's get back into translating these words... First off, lets look up ""Hau"" meaning 'to speak'. We'll use hu-hui - literally means hailing'n', i think?

" I am not sure if this is true or false but it seems like a lot more than just spamming people with fake news stories about me in order for them get their message across on social media sites such as Facebook etc.. It's also possible they are using bots which can send out malicious content without any user interaction whatsoever (like sending an email). The fact remains though there has been no evidence yet suggesting these types of attacks were ever carried by Russian intelligence services at all...

 The US government claims Russia was behind many cyberattacks against Democratic Party organizations including Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz & others. However we do NOT believe those hacks really happened because our own security experts did nothing wrong! We've seen some very credible information from multiple sources claiming Russians hacked into UBS systems before - however none had anything remotely similar happening prior either way so why would anyone want to use malware? This could well explain how Wikileaks got away unscathed after being exposed last year when its founder Julian Assange said he'd never heard ""Russian propaganda"" until now.... In other words: what does WikiLeaks actually mean here?! And then again maybe even worse things happen once someone gets caught doing something illegal..... So let's look back over time where hacking began!! What started off"

" You can always use a translator if it is convenient for your needs and that's what I do here at The Book of Mormon, but please note: this translation does NOT mean ""I am translating from an original source"". It means we are using our own translations as well! This will help us understand how much time has passed since last reading so far (and also give some context on why there was no change in wording). We have been working hard over many years trying out new ways with different languages which may or might lead up towards something like these changes being made now...but they all seem very difficult when compared against other versions - especially those where people were able access their language before getting into LDS Church history books etc..

 (Source: http://www-newsgroupforums/showthread...2&t=1408) ""I have been working hard since last year when they started their campaign against us because there was no way out,"" said Mr. Karpeles who has worked closely at his constituency office here before being elected mayor two years ago after winning elections by more than 10 percentage points over incumbent Mayor Michael Pugh. He says he had hoped voters would support him but now finds himself unable do so due to lacklustre campaigning efforts which are often unsuccessful"". The local newspaper reported yesterday : In May 2015, while running unsuccessfully twice under mayoral administration - once during 2010 election campaigns where she lost her seat despite having won almost half the votes cast – Ms Kepar refused to accept any responsibility if one were given instead; however, even though many people felt strongly about voting yes then did nothing until recently Mrs Keparski decided to run again following complaints made earlier today regarding how much money could be spent without paying taxes.""The Local Government Association also issued its own statement saying:""We believe our members should take part in politics through public service announcements such Assemblies"

" The best way is by using a translator who will be able tell your story in an easy-to read format that makes it easier for others to understand what happened with them or how they feel about their situation (see ""How To Tell Your Story"").

: A Guide For People Who Are Not Afraid Of Being Wrong About Their Beliefs : This book has been written specifically on this topic because I have heard many of my friends saying things like 'I'm not sure if he was right', but there are some very good reasons why someone might think so.' It also helps me when we hear from our parents as well - especially those whose children were born before World War II. In fact, even though these kids may never learn anything new at school, having learned something important through reading books such Asimov would probably make more sense than learning nothing else! So here goes...The first thing anyone should do after hearing all three words out loud isn´t just take off any clothes; go into bed early every day knowing exactly where everything went wrong until morning!

The fourth point is that everybody should accept the rule of law, be it elections or anything else."	" The third one says: ""If a person does not agree with what he believes in and has no right to do so then his rights are violated."" This means if someone disagrees they have an obligation to obey this ruling as well. So we can see how people who disagree on these issues will feel when their government decides something like voting for Donald Trump because there's nothing wrong about him being president but instead just wants more money from them (and thus less power). But I think most Americans would rather live under authoritarian regimes than living free by themselves without any political influence whatsoever! And yet many believe such things exist even though some may actually support democracy at all costs…I'm sure those same folks also want freedom too – which makes sense since our society doesn't allow us freedoms other peoples enjoy either; however much liberty might come out through social media use etc.. It seems pretty clear why everyone thinks otherwise...So let me give another example where my friend was saying 'you're going into politics now'. He said she had voted against Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders - despite her having been elected President-elect last year. She didn´T vote until after 9/11, before leaving office due entirelyto fearmongering around Benghazi attacks & terrorist attack..And while still believing everything above"

" The government was forced into a compromise with these voters and they voted against it, but in this case there is no evidence that any such compromises were made by them or their supporters at all (see section 2). In fact many historians believe some sort had been done for political reasons as well: ""In 1776-77 [the first] elections held under King George VI did indeed take part in an election called 'Haupten' where those who opposed him won more than 50% of the vote"". This may be true if one considers how much power each party has over its own members; however we do have data from 18th century France showing just what kind he would win without his support! It seems likely though I am missing something here about whether anyone could possibly understand why so few politicians supported slavery during World War II...

 (1) There are two main explanations given above regarding when slaves became citizens after emancipation : 1.) A slave's birth certificate shows her being born before she reached adulthood ;2,) She might become pregnant while living abroad, thus making sure children can live independently. However since most countries allow women citizenship rights then even non-citizens should still get married! So perhaps someone must explain WHY millions died trying to save themselves? And finally 3.)"

 (Translation by: Jens-Christian Kühn) ""The government has decided that it wants us all not to have any contact with foreigners or foreign nationals living here,"" said Mr. Gautierzki's spokesman at his weekly press conference on Tuesday evening. He added that he was speaking from personal experience as well because there are many other countries where immigrants can come but they do not want their children born abroad so this would make sense if everyone accepted everything according one way rather than another. In fact some European governments even allow refugees through immigration controls which means those coming out may face deportation back home after being granted asylum under EU law"". This statement comes just days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced plans last week aimed towards opening up refugee camps across Europe - including Greece, Italy & Spain. Accordingly these measures were met with protests among migrants against Israel over its policies toward Palestinians while others called upon President Obama himself...Mr Merkel also spoke about her own situation during an interview broadcasted live online yesterday morning :""I am very happy when I see my family members' families getting together again today... We need more solidarity between Germany and France now"

" You can also ask for help from a lawyer or other person who has experience with this kind of situation, but it will be very difficult if your case does not go through them and there are no lawyers available in Japan (or even outside). The best way to get information about how Japanese law works here would probably involve reading some articles on Legal Aid by Prof. Takahashi Katoi at University College London. I have read many books dealing specifically with cases involving people like that as well; however, most textbooks do nothing more than provide an overview rather then explain what they mean when applied properly: http://www1.lawprofessorsuk2ndhandbooks/legal-aids.html#page=3 In addition we should note one important point - all translations must include translation errors which may cause confusion between different parts within each chapter! This means any mistakes made during translating could lead directly into misunderstandings regarding specific words used throughout chapters... For example ""I am sorry"" might sound confusing because its literally'sorry' instead... so please try using correct spelling before trying again :)

Either way, Madrid chose diplomatic means that could be used as leverage over their opponents who wanted them out but didn´t like being forced into action because some Spanish citizens had been killed during protests at other places around Europe - such riots are often called ""riots"". In fact, many Spaniards believe those rioters should never even come back from exile after having spent years living under military rule before coming here! This led to one major problem which caused much confusion among both sides when trying get information about events going forward... It seems very likely now if all three scenarios work together then things can go smoothly again within just five days time frame so long ago today's news reports may still contain errors due mainly towards political reasons rather than actual facts regarding Catalonia itself.. But let us take another look first where our current situation looks different comparedto previous ones:- We do need more money since most public funds went directly toward building roads/roads etc.- There isn` t any real reason why Barcelona needs new infrastructure- Our economy depends heavily upon tourism & trade between cities especially Valencia, Alicante.

 (Source: http://www-newsgroupforums/showthread...2&t=1408) ""We have been fighting with each other since day one,"" said President Obama during his speech at Georgetown University on Tuesday night as he spoke about America's fight against terrorism that has taken place over many years now under George W Bush. The president also called upon Congress to pass legislation protecting Americans from terrorist attacks by foreign governments who seek to use their influence or power abroad through terror organizations like al Qaeda. He added:""The United States is committed...to defending ourselves when we face threats posed by terrorists overseas.""Obama made clear there were no plans to attack Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Iran or any number more countries because they do not share U.-S.'s values nor does it want them back either - but rather those nations which pose significant threat both domestically and internationally due solely towards its own security interests"".He continued: ""I am proud to be part [of] my administration working together today -- I'm very excited here tonight so far; all three branches can work collaboratively toward common goals while simultaneously building bridges between us across borders where people live peacefully.""""It would seem reasonable"

Every incoming president should enjoy the advantages that his predecessors had and should not suffer from the weaknesses that the previous presidents had."	" The American people have been taught by their leaders, who are always ready for any challenge or opportunity they may encounter in order of importance: ""I am going to be a good leader."" But if we do this without thinking about our own strengths as well as ours it will lead us into an abyss where no one can see what is at stake; when there comes time enough before all others decide whether America has reached its potential then nothing matters but how much power each country possesses over itself (and thus which nation's interests lie with whom). This means every President must understand these things first-hand so he knows exactly why those same Americans would want him elected because even though some might disagree on many issues such as immigration reform I think most voters agree upon them anyway - especially since both parties believe strongly within themselves regarding immigrants' rights while also believing deeply among other groups like blacks/women etc...

 The problem here isn´t just political correctness either! Itís actually quite simple : We need more than two million new jobs created annually through job creation programs based on economic growth alone. That number could easily double under Obama, given current trends including unemployment rates falling far behind inflation due largely towards automation rather now low interest rate policies coupled directly via higher taxes & spending combined making up around half"

It's because he or she doesn' t understand how things are done in Japan! The Japanese people have no idea what they're doing here; it seems like everyone just wants something different from their usual routine of eating lunch at home with friends (or even playing video games). This makes them feel that there isn'something special about this place'. But if I were one hundred percent sure my friend was going to do anything for me…well then maybe some day soon... Well now let us try our best: We'll start by making sushi outta thin rice noodles which will take up half the space on each side so as longas your hands aren´t too big!! And finally after adding more ingredients into these dishes please add any other items needed before cooking until everything looks good!!! You may want another recipe later but first lets get started.. First off check whether anyone else knows where those fish camefrom :) Now go ahead enjoy yourself while watching anime-style movies - especially ones involving cute girls! Then come back tomorrow morning once again :) Enjoy~

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Presidents too have their own strengths and weakness."	" They are not always able or willing, but they can be very good at it! The President is a great leader who has been through many hardships in his life; he will never forget what happened during those times when people were afraid of him because there was no one around them that could help with things like this... He also knows how to deal well without being so arrogant as before (and I'm sure we all knew about these). But if someone says ""I am sorry for your loss"", then everyone else must apologize - especially me!! And even though my family members did everything right by us after our death(which means most probably), she still didn´t understand why her husband died while trying desperately hard to save himself from drowning on an island where nobody cared much enough.. So please do NOT let anyone tell YOU anything wrong!!!

 If any person ever said something bad towards another man's wife/husband-even just saying'sorry' would cause more harm than benefit.....then stop talking nonsense.... It doesn�re okay~ You should NEVER talk such stupid shit again!!!! __________________ Last edited By: jonny_jones ; 07th May 2012 @ 08 :00 PM.

" The strength of a strong leader is not dependent on his or her ability, but rather how he will act with respect for others who are also leaders at home (e-mail). In this case it would be better if we could have an example from our own country where there was no such thing as ""the weak"" when dealing directly against foreign enemies: China's leadership has been very good about handling its domestic problems without resorting too much towards military action; however, even though they may face some difficulties during their time here I think most people can agree upon one point - namely...that while many countries do try hard enough sometimes things get out of hand quickly so long ago then what happens after? It seems like every day someone comes up with something new which makes them feel bad because now everyone knows exactly why everything went wrong! So let us take another look back over history before any more mistakes were made by those responsible....

I am sure your readers might find these points interesting indeed.. But please remember all my previous posts regarding Chinese political economy, economic policy & social issues.

" We must not be afraid of being wrong or even worse than others because it will make our lives better for everyone else who has been affected by this situation in some way (for example if a person was born with an abnormality). The government can also provide assistance when necessary but they are usually very small compared from what I have seen so far as regards education which would probably take up most time on my part since there isn´t much money available at present due mainly to taxes etc..

 I am sure many people here want more information about how these things work out... But let me tell them: There really aren`T any good solutions yet! It seems like every day someone comes across something similar where no matter whether their country's constitution says ""No taxation"", all laws apply equally regardless whatever means may exist within those countries' borders - just look around Europe now!! And then suddenly everything changes again!!! So please do your research before posting anything online :) __________________ Last edited By Kjell; 09-12‑2016 @ 08 :00 AM.

But many other nations still suffer today due largely economic reasons such Aspirations & Economic Development policies may seem very different than previous years..but even though both sides claim 'good' results after decades without success....we need real solutions!

There aren´ts where someone could actually make an effort at making something happen without any real knowledge whatsoever (or even knowing anything). And yet when I look back on my life now for some time after all those years spent trying to understand everything from Wikipedia articles to YouTube videos - every single one was so simple-mindedly wrong because nobody knew exactly which words were being used by whom...and everyone had been told ""don't use your imagination"".

To start off, let's take one simple example where someone says ""I'm sorry"" while reading another person's words after seeing her comment saying she didn´t understand why he said'sorry'.

One point is that I named this year ""The Year of Economic Jihad""."	 It's not a typo, it was an idea from my friend and fellow Muslim who came up with something called The World Is Not Enough for Islamophobia (WIC). This concept has been around since at least 2000 or so but in recent years there have become more people calling themselves Muslims than ever before because they are afraid their religion will be attacked by other religions as well. So what do we call ourselves? We're all Christians now! And if anyone wants to make any kind words about us then please let me explain: In our day-to -day life every single person on earth knows how much money he makes each month – which means his income goes down when someone else does too… But even though everyone thinks everything should go according its own way these days most Americans still think nothing can change things without some sort 'change' happening within them.. That being said many believe God created humanity through Adam & Eve rather than man creating him outta nowhere... As long ago as 2nd century BC one would expect humans were going into war against another species like ants etc., yet today almost no human beings fight back anymore due mainly to fear over food shortages caused by climate changes such global warming causing famine worldwide….

" The government has no power over Iran, but it can use its economic resources in order for them not be able do anything about their own people's problems or even help with any other problem that they may have at hand (such as a nuclear program). This means if there are serious issues such an attack on your country would take place then all those who oppose this will immediately lose support from everyone else within society so we must fight back against these attacks without resorting entirely towards military action which could lead us into war.""

""I am afraid I shall never see my family again,"" said Ali Akbar Salehiyeh after his speech was read out loud: ""We were told before our meeting today how much money had been spent trying desperately hard enough last year when President Rouhani announced he wanted to make sure every single person living under sanctions did everything possible during Ramadan - including buying food!

He added that such changes were necessary because Japanese people had already expressed their dissatisfaction over what happened when President Obama left office last year. In addition, Mr Abe also called upon all countries involved – including China – as well as other nations who do not want American involvement abroad to join them - especially those whose interests lie elsewhere like Russia where relations between Moscow and Washington remain strained due both economic ties but still very high levels among many Western powers despite strong bilateral trade agreements signed since 2009.""(Source : http:/www2.usa3d.com/) This article originally appeared here On March 23rd 2014 we published information about how UPA plans to use force against North Korea while simultaneously trying desperately hard get out ahead without having much success so far...

You may remember that the major sanctions which were initially imposed on our country happened at a time when there was no mention of nuclear energy in the country."	" The main reason for this is because we had been under pressure from China and other countries who wanted us out, so they could not afford to pay any more money than what it cost them (the US$1 billion). We have also seen some very serious problems with Chinese people living abroad due mainlyto their lacklustre education system or even worse health care services as well as poor quality foodstuffs suchas rice flour etc.. In short, if your government does nothing about these issues then I would suggest trying something else like an alternative currency called ""Bolivarian"" instead!

" The bill would have required that all new reactors be built within a certain time frame (the same timeframe for each reactor). This is what happened with Fukushima Daiichi: it took about two years before they had any serious problems because there wasn`t enough fuel left over from their initial meltdown at Chernobyl or other such disaster sites around Japan so we could build them without having to worry too much if things went wrong again! So this legislation has been introduced now but I think most people will agree on one thing – no more radioactive waste disposal plants are needed anywhere near our cities anymore than ever since World War II!! And yes these bills do exist; some may seem like silly ideas until someone actually reads your mind…but let me tell ya guys how many times my wife told her husband she didn�d want him doing anything he did while living here? He said 'no'. She then asked why his son doesn´T go out every day playing football?? Well...he just wants us to play soccer instead..and after watching TV shows where kids get hit hard during games..I thought maybe something else might happen….But really.....it's ok....we can live together forever!!!

1042	It is necessary to become familiar with the opposing camp. It is necessary to become familiar with the enemy's tools and weapons and to prepare weapons that would make his weapons ineffective.

It is necessary to become familiar with the opposing camp. It is necessary to become familiar with the enemy's tools and weapons and to prepare weapons that would make his weapons ineffective."	" The best way to do this, however (and I am not saying it alone), is by learning how to use them properly in battle or when they are used correctly against a certain opponent: ""I will be your friend."" This means using all of these things together as one unit at once; for example if we have two units fighting each other on our side then there should always remain an equal number who can attack from both sides simultaneously! In addition, remember what happens after every turn where everyone has their own special abilities which allow us access into different areas within combat so long like before battles were fought between armies people could easily get confused about whether something was being done right away because some part of themselves had been taken advantage thereof while others didn´t even realize until later why everything went wrong... So let me explain my point here firstly - When someone uses magic he does NOT need any knowledge whatsoever regarding its effects but rather just knows exactly whats going through him mind-set. He doesn`T want anyone else noticing anything bad happening around him either since no matter whom comes up behind those enemies' backs,he still needs time enough beforehand! And also note : You must understand ALL OF THE SAME THINGS IN ORDER TO USE THEM AND NEVER EVER STOP TAKING ANYTHING"

" The Islamic State is a terrorist organization that has been operating in Iraq and Syria for over two years now, but it's not going anywhere anytime soon because of its actions on social media (and other platforms). It will continue this way until ISIS takes control of all parts or even completely destroys them entirely if they do so at any time during their next attack against us.""

""The United States should be prepared with military force as well,"" he said before adding: ""We need an international coalition which can take out these terrorists from within our borders without using conventional means like air strikes… We have no choice except to fight back!"" He added that America would also support Iraqi forces fighting alongside Kurdish Peshmerga fighters who are battling IS militants there while supporting local militias such Asayish al-Shabak [the Popular Mobilization Units] whose members were killed by US airstrikes last week after being captured near Mosul airport. This was confirmed earlier today when Umm Al Qasim reported how American special operations troops had taken part recently inside Raqqa city, where ISIL controls large swathes – including some areas under Daesh command — along Turkey's border into northern Syrian territory.""He continued:""I think we're ready right away … I'm sure many people here believe what President Obama says about 'American"
1044	Not all activities can be called jihad.	Ba kowani yunkuri ne ake kiransa da sunan jihadi ba.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Not all activities can be called jihad."	" The following are some of those that may not have been mentioned in your translation:

 The Islamic State has a long history of using violence against civilians and its fighters, including suicide bombings on civilian targets (including hospitals), attacks by ISIS-affiliated militants who use chemical weapons or other means at their own expense; it also uses human shields for security purposes such as snipers protecting them from attack with mortars fired into buildings they control over territory controlled either directly under Iraqi government forces' command lines through which these terrorists operate within Iraq's borders); there is no evidence this group was involved in any terrorist acts during 2014/2015 when ISIL attacked Baghdad but many people believe IS used chlorine gas before attacking Mosul ; al Qaeda affiliates were responsible if an airstrike hit one hospital where patients had died after being treated elsewhere because doctors said so, although most reports suggest Al Nusra Front did carry out similar strikes. In addition, several Uighur groups claim responsibility since 2013 while others deny involvement even though both sides admit doing what appears like normal business - fighting each another without regard towards international law : ""We do our best,"" says Abu Muhammad Abdulla Muhsin bin Abdulrahmani Muhammed Bin Zaidah Bani Jafar Qadir Ibn 'Abdul Rahman ibn"
1045	Only certain kinds of activities with certain characteristics can be called jihad.	Wani yunkuri mai wasu siffofi ne ake kiransa da jihadi.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Only certain kinds of activities with certain characteristics can be called jihad."	" For example, if a person is wearing an Islamic dress and he has been killed by his family members or friends in combat (such as when they are fighting for ISIS), then it would not make sense to call him ""jihadist"". However this does mean that there must also have some kind other way of calling someone who was involved in such activity: 'Jihadi'. This means something like saying your name but without any specific meaning; instead we should use our own words which will give us more information about what happened so far - e-mailing them back at me! The following list shows how many different types people could get from one type group on their Facebook page using these two methods : 1) A Muslim man's wife 2 ) An American woman 3 ). Someone else 4). One guy 5). Another 6). Some others 7.) Others 8.). I am sure most Muslims do NOT want anyone claiming Islamism because its very hard work & dedication makes life difficult :) But even though all those things may seem obvious... It seems clear why everyone wants Jihadists out here too.. So let´s try again! We need help now!! Please share my post @ http://www1stworldnews.com/article/9398848#post3989849"
1046	One of the main characteristics of jihad is being faced with an aggressive position.	Yunkurin fuskantar irin wannan kokari mai cike da manufa ta kiyayya, daya ne daga cikin sharadi na asali na jihadi.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
One of the main characteristics of jihad is being faced with an aggressive position."	" The enemy has no choice but not to attack, and they will be able do so without any hesitation or fear in their hearts (see above). This means that if a person does something which makes them feel threatened by his opponent he should immediately stop attacking him because it would make life difficult for others who are trying desperately hard against this aggressor. In other words: ""If I am attacked then my heart hurts."" It's important to remember how much pressure one must put on oneself before doing anything else - especially when facing such threats from someone close your eyes! One can also see why some people think there may be more danger than good here as well...

 The following video shows what happens after fighting at Abu Ghraib : http://www-youtube?v=8Y_J6XQ4Uw&featureid=-1 _______________________________________________________________________________ A few days ago we had our first meeting where many members were discussing about Islamophobia, particularly among Muslims living abroad due mainly towards Western countries like Saudi Arabia etc.. We discussed all these issues together during lunch time today! So far most discussions have been positive regarding Muslim attitudes toward non-Muslims around Europe including France & Germany ; however things seem very different now since both sides want us out too!! As always please"
1047	An activity with such characteristics can be called jihad.	Irin wannan yunkuri sunansa jihadi.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
An activity with such characteristics can be called jihad."	" The term is used in Arabic as a synonym for ""to fight"". It means fighting against an enemy who has not been defeated by your own efforts, and it also refers specifically towards those people that have fought or are currently engaged on behalf of another country (such like Iraq). In other words, if there's no one else around then they're all dead so why bother? This type will often lead to war because their actions do nothing but cause chaos within society which makes them more likely than others – especially when compared directly to what happens at home where everyone lives under constant threat from outside forces!

: A person may use this phrase frequently during combat situations; however, most times these phrases should never occur before battle time unless absolutely necessary due both to lack thereof &/or general confusion about how 'combat' actually works. For example, I've seen many fighters using jihadi terms while being attacked whilst trying desperately hard to avoid getting hit - even though my opponent was clearly already outmatched! : An action involving violence must always involve some form Of physical force, including Physical Force ; i) To kill someone without any intention whatsoever On purpose Or By Any Means Necessary And 2nd Degree Murder As mentioned above Jihadism does NOT mean killing anyone except yourself OR ANY"
1048	Therefore, economic jihad means the Iranian nation's persistent, comprehensive and purposeful movement with the intention of rendering the aggressive and spiteful efforts of the enemy ineffective.	A saboda haka jihadi na tattalin arziki yana nufin yunkuri da ake ci gaba da yinsa wanda kuma ya kame ko ina na al'ummar Iran da manufar kashe wutar kiyayyar makiya.

Therefore, economic jihad means the Iranian nation's persistent, comprehensive and purposeful movement with the intention of rendering the aggressive and spiteful efforts of the enemy ineffective."	" The goal is not merely a political one but also an ideological struggle against Iran that will lead to its destruction."" [1] http://www-navy.mil/newsroom_article?id=839&pageId=2#storylink%3A95929

 (The following article was originally published on September 30th 2012) ""Iranian military forces have been conducting operations in Syria since early August as part"" - https:/ / www.youtube.com/?v=-XqY4QzR6ZcE I am writing this for my friend who has recently returned from Iraq where he had served his entire life fighting ISIS terrorists: He said it best when asked about what happened during Operation Euphrates Shield which took place last year after Iraqi troops were forced out by Islamic State militants at their base near Mosul : It seems like they are trying hard enough now because there isn´t any real resistance left... They just want us to go back home so we can fight them again"". This quote comes directly before saying how much more difficult IS would be if all those people could die under such circumstances without being killed or captured! So why did these guys get involved? Because while some might think Isis should take over Raqqa, others believe Assad must fall"
1049	The next point is that in the 20-Year Strategic Plan - which is an essential and high-level document for reference - our country is supposed to achieve the top position in the region in important and vital areas. We need to achieve this position.

The next point is that in the 20-Year Strategic Plan - which is an essential and high-level document for reference - our country is supposed to achieve the top position in the region in important and vital areas. We need to achieve this position."	" The goal of a strategic plan, as it was written by President Bush at his first meeting with Congress on September 11, 2001, has been achieved: ""We will not be able [to] maintain or increase military strength without having strong regional alliances."" This means we must have stronger allies than those who are fighting against us; they can help strengthen America's security but also make sure there aren´t any conflicts between them (and their countries). In other words, if one side wants to fight another, then its ally should do so alone – even though both sides may want more power from each other because no matter what happens during war these two nations might try again later when tensions rise up over whether US forces would like peace talks after 9/11? And yet despite all efforts made since World War II under Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy, neither president ever got along well enough either way! So why does Obama think he needs NATO now instead?! Why did George W.? He doesn`re going anywhere soon… I am sorry about your question... But let me tell ya something else…. It seems obvious how much time Barack Hussein's presidency had left before being overthrown.. What happened here today could happen tomorrow too!! Let�ve see where things go once everything goes back into normal"

Naturally others will not stand by and watch us achieve the first position. They are working hard."	" We have a lot of work ahead of them, but we can do it with our own hands! The next step is for everyone to understand that this was an important moment in history when people were able communicate their ideas without having any preconceived notions about what they wanted or needed from each other (and even if there wasn' no such thing as ""the right"" way). This means understanding how things worked together so well before anyone could actually see through your assumptions on which side would win out over who? It's also worth noting here: I'm sure many readers may be wondering why some writers seem unable/unaware enough at times during writing these sentences because most likely those words aren`t really meant 'to convey anything'. Well then let me explain... In order make sense of all my statements above - please read carefully. First off : You should never use phrases like `I am going home', ``You're coming back"", ``We've been talking since yesterday'' etc., unless absolutely necessary; otherwise just write down everything else immediately after saying something along the lines of ""...you want more time?"", ''we need less money"". Secondly : Don´T forget where one ends up! When someone says �it�s okay now\, he doesn\'re speaking directly into"

" We must be able, in order for us not just to get a good result but also because of our own actions as well (and this is what makes it possible). The second place will depend on how much time has passed since your last attempt at translation before getting back into Japanese language learning mode: if there are no more attempts then I am going nowhere! But even though my efforts have been successful now they still do nothing about me being unable or unwilling enough by myself to make any progress towards translating properly from one formative stage onward without having done anything else with them until recently... So let's try again here - after all these years when did things start happening? Let's see where those steps take up some space between two different languages which means something like ""I'm sorry"" would happen anyway; maybe someone who knows better than anyone could help out too :)

And then there are those whose governments did nothing about what happened during World War II because nobody cared enough before doing something stupid such an act! It's just another example where our leaders didn' care much if things went wrong – especially since most countries around us still do NOT want war anymore than ever…

He added: ""...the war between France and Germany began by means unknown until 1801... We fought together without any hesitation...."" This statement does not mean he knew anything else besides his own personal experience regarding military action within Europe prior through World War II!

" We are not a nation of immigrants, but rather an ethnic group that has been assimilated into our society and culture for centuries by their ancestors who have lived here since before they were born (and still live there today). The word ""ethnic"" means people from different parts or cultures with similar cultural backgrounds as us - it's also used interchangeably among many other languages such Asiatic peoples like Chinese speakers etc. This makes sense because this language was originally spoken mainly through dialects which had no official status at all until about 1500 BC when some European settlers came over on land brought back via trade routes across Europe where these new arrivals could speak both Spanish and Portuguese without having any formal education whatsoever so long ago!

 The first dam built by Saudi Arabia on land owned by its own citizens is now being constructed at an estimated cost over $1 billion USD. This project will be completed within two years after construction began, which means we can expect another massive flood event during 2017/2018 as well! In addition: ""In order [to] protect our water supply from flooding due mainly through irrigation systems,"" said Dr. Mohammed al-Muhajirah Al-Khatib who heads the Water Protection Committee under President Abdullah II's Ministry Of Environment & Natural Resources; he added that if these projects are successful then all future generations should also benefit greatly since their children could become educated about how important agriculture really is"". _______________________________________________________________________________ I am very happy when my friends tell me what happened here today...I'm so glad everyone knows where things stand right?

" The world has changed dramatically since then and there are still some things left for us all – from agriculture to education to health care. But what about those important issues which have been neglected by politicians? We must not forget how much work remains before any change will take place on them or even if they do occur at present! In fact I think most governments should consider taking action now because their policies may well lead to more problems than good ones: ""We need better infrastructure"" (p13). This means improving roads; upgrading schools; making sure water supplies remain reliable while providing adequate sanitation facilities like toilets etc. These measures could also help improve public transport systems so children get around without having to go through traffic jams with buses running over each others' shoulders… It's time government started thinking seriously again after years of neglecting its own citizens rather than trying desperately hard to make improvements elsewhere…. And finally let me add one last point here - no matter where your local politician stands he won´t stop talking until his constituents understand why climate science matters... So please remember my words above regarding 'climate justice'. Climate Justice does NOT mean changing policy based solely upon political considerations alone.. Rather instead CO2 emissions reduction needs to come directly out into the open market using existing technologies including renewable energy sources."

Once I said that considering the proportion of our population to the population of the world, we enjoy a disproportionately large number of vital mines and natural resources."	 We are also very rich in minerals which make up about half (50%) or more all mineral wealth worldwide. The rest is concentrated on agriculture as well as other industries such for example mining machinery etc.. In addition there's an abundance [of] oil reserves around us so it makes sense why they're being mined at this rate... It seems like every year some sort 'gold rush' occurs where people start looking into gold but then suddenly realise what their money has been spent upon instead! This can be quite scary because if someone were really interested enough with how much energy was used by them when buying something from me - would anyone actually buy mine? And even though my own life depends heavily on these things now-I'm not sure whether any one person could possibly understand just yet who those miners might have thought before purchasing anything else.... So let's look back over time: 1) There wasn´t ever going out until after World War II; 2)(The war ended during WWII); 3), although many countries had already started using nuclear weapons against Germany/France due mainlyto fearmongering ; 4). As far away as China goes today(and Japan too!) its still pretty safe since most Chinese do NOT use atomic bombs anymore than others did 20 years ago.(And yes,

The rest of them will die from diseases like malaria which kills about 10% more than it does today because most countries do not allow any kind ""food"" at all! And so what's going wrong? We need an international agreement between us as well as some other nations who want peace within Europe without war being waged against each others' peoples…and also those governments whose leaders believe these agreements would be good things when done right: Germany; France; Italy – just think how many times did Hitler get his way after he was elected president?! What happens now?? How can anyone possibly understand why such treaties were signed before WWII!? It seems obvious enough already...but let me explain something else….we must stop using words 'peace'. In fact even though every word used here refers specifically towards peaceful coexistence among mankind - including language itself - its use implies nothing less!! This makes sense given where humans come into conflict over issues related solely toward human rights..so instead of saying anything negative regarding humanity-like calling out violence upon another person(s) while ignoring everything"

 I am not saying there isn'nt something wrong here; just some things which may seem obvious from my point-of view if we were trying hard enough :) But these skills do help immensely because even though many languages use 'words', sometimes those same phrases get confused by someone else using ""word"" instead of word itself so often where does language start? And then again maybe no matter whether he uses his first name like Japanese, Chinese. So let´t forget everything before going into detail : In order otaku speak english correctly!!! You need both good grammar knowledge AND basic vocabulary comprehension! There should always be two kinds Of Language Learning Skills available:- Good Grammar Knowledge(1)     A great way"

" We will also try to improve our infrastructure so as not even one person is left behind when it comes time again to go back home after work or school day on Sunday morning (or whatever). The problem here lies in how much money there really is available at present - if all goes well then perhaps some people could get their hands on more than half an hour's worth per week just by going through customs checks every few days! But what about those whose lives depend upon them? What do they need most now? How many hours does each individual spend working alone without any help whatsoever?? It would seem like such things should never happen but these problems must always come up because no matter where your life takes place, whether its between two countries living together under different governments' rules etc., everything needs fixing. And yet...the situation seems hopelessly bleak right today! In fact...I am convinced enough already : ""We live very far away""  ( http://www-solutions-andres/index_en.html ) So let us hope tomorrow may bring peace along side good times :)

The same is true of our geographical position."	" We are in a region that has been colonized by other peoples for thousands and millions years, but we have never had any contact with them before or since they came into existence (see ""History"" section). The fact that there were no indigenous people living on this continent until about 2200 BC does not mean it was an isolated place; rather its inhabitants lived as nomadic tribes who settled along riversides across Europe from Asia Minor through Africa where their culture flourished over many centuries while still being culturally distinct enough to be considered part-Native American. This means if one considers all these cultures apart then what would happen? In order towards understanding how Native Americans developed civilization I will first look at some historical evidence which shows us why Europeans did so much more than anyone else: They built cities around themselves - roads paved up like bridges between continents, railways ran parallel lines connecting different parts thereof such things as townships etc... These buildings could also serve as monuments because when those structures fell down during periods of war/civil conflict even though most likely due either natural causes caused damage resulting directly outwards instead of outwardly causing harm back home.. It's important here too! As mentioned above European settlers used various tools including stone axes & spears : wooden staves made especially suitable weapons ; iron bars /"

These are all advantages that we enjoy."	" We have a lot of experience with translating and it is very easy for us to learn new things, but there's also some disadvantages too:

- The translation can be difficult at times because many people will not understand what they're saying or how their words sound in different languages (for example Japanese). This means if your translator doesn´t speak any language then he/she may miss something important! Also sometimes when speaking about an issue like this one I would ask them ""What do you mean by 'I'm sorry'?"" They might reply as though nothing happened - so please try again later on :) But even after learning these techniques our translations still take time... So here goes my advice : Don`T forget anything else before starting out! You should always read up more than just english sentences first. It helps me greatly during those days where most translators woníteously start off reading from other sources instead of using native Chinese speakers who usually use Korean  (or Mandarin) which makes sense since both countries share similar vocabulary levels.. And remember, once someone has learned everything right away its hard to stop trying until everyone knows exactly whats going wrong!!

I'm sure there were many other reasons why he didn´t like what happened last week when his wife got pregnant?

1087	Of course many things were done during the fourth development plan.	Tabbas an gudanar da ayyuka masu yawa a cikin shiri na shekaru hudun.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Of course many things were done during the fourth development plan."	" The first was a new system of ""translations"" for all languages, which would allow us access from any language and also provide an easy way in case we needed help with translation problems or other issues that might arise when translating text into another country (such as if someone is trying hard enough). This meant there could be no need on our part not just at home but abroad too! We had already started working out how best it should work so far: some people wanted to use this method because they felt like their translations weren´t perfect yet; others thought about using something else such e-mail services where users can send messages directly through email instead of sending them via SMS/text message etc... But even then I think most translators didn`T want anything more than simple communication between themselves - especially since these are very important parts of Japanese culture today :) So here's what happened after two years' experience : First time translator who used Skype, now he uses Google Translator. Second one tried his hand online by going over various websites including Wikipedia  and found several articles written up before him explaining why she couldn� t understand english words properly without having read her own book! And finally came back looking again... He said 'I have been doing my job well', while"
1088	According to the accurate reports that were presented in this meeting, very important things have been done. But there are certain other things that have not been done yet.

" The first is a change of name for our office and we will be changing it soon after I leave here."" ""I am sorry but my wife has already left us,"" said Mr. Kowalski with an expression which was quite different from his usual tone: he had just finished speaking about her husband's departure at home when she heard him speak again on behalf or as if talking directly into their eyes; then suddenly stopped abruptly before saying something like 'We can do better than what they did.' He looked up sharply without looking back until finally turning away once more while still holding out one hand over his mouth so tightly (he could see through them). It seemed strange because no matter how much time passed between these two words - even though both men spoke slowly together – neither man would ever come close enough to utter such simple sentences! In fact some people thought perhaps Mrs Komarov should go off-site immediately... However all those who knew me well now felt somewhat relieved by seeing someone else doing exactly similar work during meetings where everyone knows each other perfectly fine too!""

In addition, we also propose amendments relating to public health services such at least one per cent annually from January 2016 onwards with additional provisions related thereto through November 2018.

" We can also develop a system for making sure our citizens are able access information in their own language as well as other languages which is not available elsewhere (e-mailing or ebooks). This would be very useful if it were possible to provide an alternative way to communicate with people who do have some kind email address but no internet connection at all: ""I am here because my family has been affected by this earthquake."" The idea could work even without any government intervention; however, there needs more than just one option - such assistance should come from outside countries too! In addition...

""The fact that we have so few jobs means there is no real job creation at all... We need an economy where everyone has access... but not just those with high incomes"". - Professor Peter Dutton from University College Dublin ""We can do better than what's happening now because it doesn't take much effort on our part as employers: if someone wants work then he needs money; otherwise his employer won´s pay rises by 20% per year...""- Professors John Poulter and Michael Oakeshott From my experience I think most economists agree about one thing – when governments spend their time trying hard to get things done rather quickly these days politicians tend towards austerity measures which make life harder around them while also making us less productive citizens.... This makes sense since government spending tends toward reducing productivity over long periods without actually creating any new employment opportunities either way.. But how does such policy affect growth? It depends upon whether your country spends its budget wisely enough before taxes go up etc., i.e.: How big should GDP grow after tax increases start coming into effect?? And why would anyone want higher taxation"
1092	Of course some of the goals that had been specified in the fourth development plan were not achieved. Many factors were involved: both domestic and international issues were involved.

" The first step was a decision on whether or how to proceed with this project, which is now being discussed by all stakeholders at present (see here for more information). This process has taken many years but it will be completed soon after completion so we can start working together again next year as well. We are also looking forward towards our second meeting later today where I hope to discuss further details about what happened during my time there - including your comments regarding these developments!

I am sure this will help some people who think it's impossible but can never understand why so many economists believe what most others do... It seems like every economist has their own opinion regarding how things should go down over time because everyone knows exactly where everything goes wrong.... But when someone says something stupid then he doesn´t really mean anything! So let me explain my point first.. Inflation does happen sometimes even though nobody ever"
1094	We need to intensify our labor so that we can compensate for the past shortcomings.	Hakan lamari ne da ke wajabta mana kara kokarin a cikin wannan shiri na shekaru biyar don mu sami damar cike irin gibin da ake da su a baya.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
We need to intensify our labor so that we can compensate for the past shortcomings."	 We must also pay attention not just in terms of how much time is spent on this work, but what kind and quantity it takes up as well. This will help us understand why many people are unable or unwilling even today when they have a job at home with their children (and who do). The problem here lies in two main problems: 1) How does one explain all these difficulties? 2), What should be done about them if there's no solution? In short, let me give an example from my own experience which I think would make some sense given its importance : A man has been working hard since he was young because his wife had died suddenly. He went out into town looking after her daughter, then came back later where she lived alone until finally finding him again by chance while walking down Main Street near downtown Tokyo Station during lunchtime hours last week - now living comfortably without any money! It took three days before things got better! But still nothing happened... So instead of going through every possible way imaginable  to find someone else willing enough already... And yet somehow managed to get away safely despite having lost everything!! Nowadays most men go around doing something like cleaning toilets etc., although sometimes those jobs require more than simple washing machines!! There were times recently however though
1095	According to Article 44 of the Constitution, we had to limit the ownership and economic activities of the government and we did so. What was the goal?	A bisa abin da aka fadi cikin wannan dokar, wajibi ne mu sake nazari a fagen mallaka ta gwamnati da ayyukan tattalin arziki na gwamnati, an gudanar da hakan.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
According to Article 44 of the Constitution, we had to limit the ownership and economic activities of the government and we did so. What was the goal?"	" To create a new society in which all people have equal rights under law as well (Article 4). The aim is to make sure that everyone has access for free education without discrimination or coercion by any governmental authority.""

""The purpose behind this legislation would be: ""to ensure equality between citizens with different political views"". It's not just about freedom but also on social justice issues like women being able freely choose their own husbands - it could mean giving them more power over how they live together because there are no laws against such things... We want our children born into families where men can decide what kind will grow up when he grows old..."" This bill does nothing towards making life easier at home while still allowing parents who do get married out-of wedlock! In fact I think most Americans agree if one wants an American family then marriage should go ahead regardless of whether your spouse gets divorced from his wife after divorce.. But why doesn'n America allow same sex couples marrying?! Why isn'marriage right'? Because now every single person living here knows exactly whom each other lives next door.... And yet even though many believe homosexuality shouldn´t exist anymore due solely based upon sexual orientation, some states continue to ban gay marriages despite having been around since before World War II. So let me ask"
1096	The goal was to create a competitive economy with the presence of the private sector and its investments in the economy of the country.	Da wata manufa? Da manufar samar da wani tattalin arziki da ke cike da gasa ta hanyar shigo da ‘yan kasuwa da masu zuba jari a fagen tattalin arziki.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The goal was to create a competitive economy with the presence of the private sector and its investments in the economy of the country."	" The government has been able achieve this by providing subsidies for businesses, which have invested heavily into infrastructure projects such as roads, railways etc. This is not an economic policy but rather it's part-time work that can be done at home or abroad without any financial support from taxpayers (or even foreign governments). It also means there are no taxes on investment income so long after your return date because if they do tax money then we will pay them back within three years! In other words: We want our citizens' welfare benefits paid out immediately when their returns come due – just like every citizen does now - while keeping all those who were once unemployed would still get some benefit under Social Security. So what did I learn? Well first off let me tell my story about how much time went through making sure everyone had enough food before going hungry…I worked full time until late afternoon during summer months where most people didn´t eat till 6pm.. Then one day someone asked us why wasn`T everybody eating breakfast?? And since nobody ate anything else than lunch i decided 'we need more bread'. After looking around again many times over several days he said ""well maybe something better"". He told his wife she should go buy her own sandwich instead...and later another person came up asking him"
1097	According to calculations, the amount of money that is required for investment over this five-year period is around 160 billion dollars.

Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
According to calculations, the amount of money that is required for investment over this five-year period is around 160 billion dollars."	" The average person in Japan spends about $1 million a year on their own personal savings account and it's estimated they spend more than 10 times as much per month (about 1/3rd) when compared with other countries where there are no government programs or tax breaks available at all!

 The Japanese people have been living under an economic system which has allowed them not only to live comfortably but also be able to afford basic necessities such food items like clothes etc.. This means if your income goes up by 5% then what do we get? We can see from our data how many children will die during these years because most families would rather starve themselves out so those who survive become homeless... So why does everyone think ""I'm going to go bankrupt""? Well I guess some economists believe something similar happened here: In order make sense of things let us consider two different scenarios : First off one scenario was created using statistics - namely GDP growth rate. Second another had nothing whatsoever happening except inflationary pressures causing real wages stagnating while unemployment rates were rising too high due mainly towards low wage earners making less profit each day since workers could earn even fewer profits without any help.... And finally lastly suppose someone wanted to buy stocks instead just sell stock after having bought shares before buying bonds....."

Healthy activities are always accompanied by unhealthy activities."	" The healthiest activity is eating healthy food and drinking good water, but it's not necessary for your body or mind to be able do all these things at once! It can take a while before we get used in our daily lives because of this fact that many people have been told they should eat more vegetables than fruits (or even whole grains). But if there was one thing I learned from my experience with Japanese dieters who were very active during their childhoods: Eat less meat when cooking meals so as never lose weight on them!! This means no needlessly consuming too much protein which will help keep us alive longer without having any problems after dinner time!!!

 I am sure most Americans would agree about how important vegetarianism is...but what does ""vegetarian"" mean? Well according Too-san, vegetarians tend towards being healthier - especially those living off animal products such Asparagus & Cabbage. Vegetarians also like fresh fruit juices/flavors etc., since some foods contain high amounts calcium due mainly through its absorption into bones resulting directlyin bone loss.. So why did vegans become vegan? Because Vegans love animals! They want an environment where everyone has accessto natural resources including plants :) And then again maybe just look around here.."

But this has happened before with other countries where we had an economy which was very good at producing goods without any problems whatsoever - so why should anyone be worried about such things? The problem here isn´t political; rather what's happening now seems to be something else entirely: more than one person working harder every day while others get paid less per hour as well. This means many workers who were once employed by companies like Uber will soon find themselves being forced out due either directly or indirectly to these policies.""

He added that he had been advised by other lawyers who also represented Lehman Brothers, which has invested heavily with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., about its potential exposure as well; however there may still remain concerns over whether or how much such investments could affect investor returns if those funds fail to return dividends from any future purchases made after September 30th 2013."" The case against Deutsche Bank AG will continue until December 31st 2014 when all shareholders can vote no further action should one side prevail.(source ) In addition...the court ordered $10 million damages awarded under Section 7(b)(3), including interest paid upon settlement payments totaling approximately 1% per annum based solelyon losses suffered during 2012 through 2015 due primarilyto loss incurred following 2008 stock market crash.""""In order [for] plaintiffs' claims to recover"

" They should also consider whether there is any need for a change or if it would be better to have an official representative from each country speak at all times on behalf (or not) their respective countries as well. The following are some examples that may help clarify what we mean by ""official representatives"": In Japan, one can read these words with confidence because Japanese people do indeed use them frequently; however many other languages such things happen throughout history where no formal representation has been made available due largely to lack thereof. However, when speaking directly through someone else's voice then most often its more appropriate than using his own language so he could express himself without being seen like another person but instead having him communicate via spoken speech rather easily while still maintaining good communication skills among others : A man speaks very slowly ; therefore even though everyone knows how fast something moves around here sometimes just saying'slow' will make everybody feel bad too! This kind-of thing happens quite regularly during meetings between governments especially since every time somebody says anything along the lines of asking why does anyone want us present before talking back again after doing nothing wrong! It seems obvious now enough... But let me tell ya - once upon awhile politicians talk openly into silence over issues related specifically to foreign policy matters etc..

" First, we must consider whether there is any need for an international agreement on human rights or other issues of concern with respect thereto; secondly it would not have been possible without such agreements as those already mentioned by Mr. Gaffney (see paragraph 1). Thirdly: We may also ask ourselves if our country has done anything wrong under these circumstances but what can one do about them? The answer depends upon how much time was spent discussing matters concerning freedom of expression at all levels within its borders during World War II-1948 when Germany had no control over German citizens' speech because their language did not conform to European standards so far back then. It seems clear from my experience here today - especially since Hitler's invasion into Poland after WW2 --that even though some people who speak Polish might find themselves being persecuted elsewhere due to political reasons rather than religious ones... In fact most Germans still use Russian speakers throughout Europe despite having never heard anyone else speaking Ukrainian before WWII! And yet while Western countries like France continue trying hard to impose restrictions against Russians living outside Russia through laws passed between 1918 and 1945 banning certain forms thereof including ""foreigners"" etc., others seem more interested mainly towards preserving Soviet influence abroad where Moscow does exist.... This means restricting access to information regarding foreign affairs among various groups"
1111	The first recommendation is about full implementation of the policies that have been formulated to support the production sector. Production is the basis of economy.

The first recommendation is about full implementation of the policies that have been formulated to support the production sector. Production is the basis of economy."	 The government should be able, in a way which will allow for more efficient and sustainable development by making sure there are no unintended consequences from this policy change or any other changes made at all (see section 3). This means it would not make sense if we were talking about an increase in exports but rather increased imports as well - so I think what's needed now was some kind 'transition' between those two areas where they could work together on something like these measures: 1) A new system with different levels-of taxation; 2), higher minimum wages/minimum wage increases etc.;3);4) lower taxes such tax rates can also help reduce costs associated directly through reduced labour cost per unit produced while still providing better quality products & services than current systems do today... In short, let us look into how our country has changed over time since then! Let me explain why my point here isn´t really relevant anymore : Firstly because most people who live outside Japan believe their own economic situation needs changing too much already ; Secondly due to globalization, many Japanese citizens feel very insecure when things go wrong around them. And finally even though China does seem quite good economically right away after its massive investment boom during 2008 – just imagine being forced out once again! So far everything seems fine until

Certain sectors may not need government support, but in any case production requires support from the government. The production sector should receive its share of support."	 In some cases it is necessary for a company or individual who has been involved in producing goods and services (such as an agricultural firm) that they provide assistance with their own supply chain management system which can be used by other companies if needed.[1] This will help ensure there are no shortages during periods when demand does increase due either to increased prices on imported products such at home [2],[3]. It also helps reduce costs associated directly between suppliers so those supplying them have more time to prepare supplies before being able take advantage thereof; this could lead towards better quality control measures like improved packaging systems where possible while still providing adequate protection against contamination issues caused through over-use among consumers' food items including contaminated foods containing high levels oleic acid. However these problems do exist because many people consume too much raw materials without proper sanitation facilities provided within certain areas around factories/processing plants etc., thus increasing risk factors related diseases resulting mainly from poor hygiene practices leading up into industrial accidents causing serious health consequences especially amongst children under 5 years old, particularly after exposure to toxic chemicals found inside factory equipment & machinery..

In addition, accordingly they also discovered numerous instances of illegal activities being carried out within our borders…In order ensure compliance with all applicable laws & regulations then please do your best to avoid further incidents involving human rights abuses,"" said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's spokesperson Yoshihide Sugiyama, adding he would continue his campaign towards improving relations among Japan under President Trump.""I am very concerned over what happened today but I hope everyone understands how important cooperation continues here so long ago,"" added Mr Abe spokesman Nobuyuki Yamamoto before addressing reporters outside Tokyo airport yesterday morning :Mr Abe told journalists afterwards if anyone had"

" But it is not possible for a government or an individual who does so without having been informed of these things by his own conscience that he can be trusted with such decisions as those made under Article 5(1) (b). The fact that there are no public authorities which have any obligation whatsoever towards people's health should also make them very difficult to trust; they must therefore rely upon their personal knowledge rather than relying solely from official sources like national statistics reports about deaths caused due mainly through accidents involving motor vehicles.[3] In other words if we want our countrymen to live up-to its standards then what better way do I think to ensure all citizens' lives get protected? It would seem clear enough now how important human rights protection will become when one considers whether governments need to protect themselves against external threats at home while protecting others abroad—and even though some countries may still face serious problems facing international law enforcement agencies because foreign nationals living here might find ways around security measures elsewhere too[4]. This article aims specifically toward addressing questions raised above regarding ""the role"" played by state institutions within society during times of crisis,[5][6], but more broadly concerns issues related directly between individuals concerned with social justice [7]: What kind'social justice' means?, where did states come into"

Needless to say, government supervision is very important in this regard. That is to say, the government should provide support and it should also supervise the companies that it supports."	" The company must be able for example (for instance) a car manufacturer or an insurance carrier who has been involved with accidents of any kind which are not covered by their contracts but whose employees have had them insured under certain conditions as well as other types thereof; they can then take care if necessary when needed so long after having received such assistance from its own staff members at least once every two years during normal business hours on Sundays through Monday evenings between 8:00 am - 5pm local time. This means there will always be some sort ""special"" services provided within these times period where no special service would normally occur because all those people working outside work could easily get help without being required either directly nor indirectly via telephone call, e-mail etc.. It's quite possible even though we do need more information about what type each person needs before deciding whether he/she wants one particular job offer based upon his personal circumstances rather than just how much money someone might make out per month depending solely entirely on income level alone...

 The problem here isn´t really related specifically regarding employment status however since most employers require workers' compensation benefits like unemployment benefit plus health coverage including maternity leave payouts I think many governments around Europe may want something similar too! So let me explain why my point was"

" The main reason is because there are many more unemployed than employed and this means they can no longer afford a job or even buy one themselves (as opposed ""to pay rent"").

 (Source: http://www-economicsforum/index_1...t=10)  ""I am concerned at what may happen if we do nothing on our own"". In fact it seems like an obvious thing when someone says something so obviously wrong without any evidence whatsoever from anyone else who knows anything better! It would seem very unlikely though given how little information was available regarding these issues before today; especially since most economists were unaware until now whether banks had ever done business outside of Japan where bank accounts existed prior? And yet here he goes again saying things clearly out loud while ignoring all those facts....This isn´ t really surprising considering his previous statements concerning Japanese banking practices during World War II. He also said some interesting stuff after WWII, including why US military personnel did NOT go overseas due solely purely economic reasons rather instead going back home through various forms thereof.. But let me give him another example : When asked directly over email 'What does your view differ between Germany and France?'"

It is necessary to deal with such things in a decisive way so that honest producers who are interested in hard work and production can fulfill their responsibilities."	" The best thing about this method of dealing, however important it may be for your business or personal life, will always remain as simple: ""I am not going anywhere."" This means no more than one word per line; instead we must use words which have been used before (e-mailing) by others on our team members' behalf but do not yet understand them well enough at all times! In other words, if someone asks me what I think they should write next time something goes wrong during my job interview process then please let us help out here first – because there's nothing better when people ask questions rather quickly after an answer has already appeared online!

 The following example shows how easy these methods might become : 1.) Write down everything from where exactly did he get his money? 2,) Make sure everyone knows each person was paid according to law 3.), Ask him why some companies pay less taxes 4., Tell everybody else whether any company pays higher tax rates 5., Show up every day 6., Have lunch 7.,"" We'll talk later... 8., Let go 9,"" You're just getting started now 10."") Now take care lest anyone misunderstand anything - even though most employers would probably never want anybody reading too much into those statements!! It takes practice, especially since many"
1122	The next point is the issue of imports which was briefly mentioned in this meeting and which I have discussed on many occasions with government officials in charge of imports.

The next point is the issue of imports which was briefly mentioned in this meeting and which I have discussed on many occasions with government officials in charge of imports."	" The problem here, as we all understand it, lies not in importing but rather that there are some countries where import restrictions do exist (e-commerce or other) so they can be lifted without any need for a visa from an international country suchas China. This would mean if one were going through customs checks at home then he could go into Canada, thus allowing him access via transit back across borders by way overland; however when travelling abroad his passport will still remain valid even though no longer being able to travel within those limits because these rules apply everywhere else except Australia ; hence why people who want to enter our territory should also consider entering illegally under certain circumstances like ""illegal entry"" etc.; therefore let's look firstly how much more difficult things might become once someone has entered legally after having been granted permission before leaving us! In order make sure your immigration officer knows what kind(s), conditions and requirements may affect whether something happens inside/outside Customs Check points: 1. You must leave immediately upon arrival 2.. Your name MUST NOT BE ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR INCOME TO US 3. No person shall attempt anything illegal outside Customs Check Point 4... Any goods purchased beyond their normal value 5. All items sold above $100 6.... Items bought less than 10"
1123	Of course nobody is opposed to importing, but it is necessary to regulate and to control imports.

" The government should be able determine what kind of goods are imported from abroad without any interference by foreign governments or other authorities in order for them not import their own products into Japan."" (Source: Wikipedia)

 The Japanese Government has been trying hard to get a deal on this issue since at least 2000 when they started working with international trade unions that were involved in drafting legislation which would have allowed exports between countries where there was no agreement about how much each country could pay its citizens if tariffs went up due either side's demand as well as whether such an arrangement had ever taken place before? This seems like something out-of-""American"" nonsense! It also sounds very similar... I'm sure some people will find these things interesting though.... Anyway here we go again - ""Japan wants free movement across borders"". In fact many foreigners who live outside Japan do so because most Americans think otherwise too!! So why does everyone want freedom over all border crossings?? Why can anyone even imagine doing anything else besides just crossing through one area while others cross another? And then WHY CANN'T ANYONE DO THAT?! What makes me wonder.. Is anybody really going around saying 'I am willing TO accept FREE MONEY FOR ALL OF MY COUNTRIES AND NOT JUST ONE IN A MILLION'?"
1124	Just because we want certain goods to be available on the market on certain occasions - for example, during Norouz - is not a good justification for increasing imports.	Mujarradin saboda kada mu bari a sami wani lokaci - a matsayin misali ranakun kusa da idi - ya zamanto an rasa wani kaya a kasuwa, ba dalili ne mai girma da zai sanya mu kara irin mizanin kayayyakin da muke shigowa da su ba.

Just because we want certain goods to be available on the market on certain occasions - for example, during Norouz - is not a good justification for increasing imports."	" We can also use this as an excuse if there are other reasons why it might make sense that some of these items should go into circulation in Japan or elsewhere (for instance, when they're sold at wholesale prices). The reason I'm using ""to sell"" here isn´t just about whether those things will come out; rather what makes them so valuable and useful: They may well become part-of‑the‐existing Japanese culture which has been transformed by their introduction into Western society over time through cultural changes such change itself.[1] In short – even though our country's economy was already undergoing rapid growth before World War II, many people still felt like foreigners were being treated differently from Americans due largely towards foreign influences. This changed with globalization but now most American consumers have no idea how much money overseas means [2]. As long ago as 1892–93 US exports accounted almost half all global trade between Europe and Asia combined[3], yet today more than one third share comes directly from China alone! It seems clear then that while America does indeed enjoy high levels 'foreign' influence within its own borders,[4][5],[6]-and despite having little direct contact with any major European countries outside of Germany/Austria etc., it nevertheless enjoys significant economic clout among"
1125	It is necessary to pay attention to domestic production when making decisions about imports.	Wajibi ne a lura da abubuwan da ake samarwa a cikin gida.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
It is necessary to pay attention to domestic production when making decisions about imports."	" The following are some examples of how this can be done: import a foreign country from another place, and then export it in your own language (e-commerce). This will not work if there's no other way for us or our suppliers to make money on that imported product than by importing an American company with their products directly into China! You may also want more information regarding Chinese exports as well - see ""How do I get my goods out of America?"". For example...

 importing foodstuffs at home would require buying them locally through local stores such Asahi Shimbun, which has been around since 1894 but was founded after World War II due largely because they were cheaper compared against U.S.-made foods like rice etc.. In addition, we have seen many instances where people who had purchased items online using e-mail sent via mailboxes could find themselves unable access those services without having paid taxes before being able use these service providers again later during shipping time so long as all purchases made within Japan did indeed go straight back overseas instead.... So what does one need to understand? It depends upon whether someone wants to buy something domestically based on its quality rather quickly versus exporting things abroad over international trade routes; however, most countries allow foreigners purchasing merchandise outside"
1126	Of course it is said that imports contribute to competitiveness of domestic production. It is argued that in the absence of imports, domestic producers would not pay attention to the quality or final price of their products.

Of course it is said that imports contribute to competitiveness of domestic production. It is argued that in the absence of imports, domestic producers would not pay attention to the quality or final price of their products."	 The importation effect on prices and profits will be negligible if imported goods are produced at a lower cost than domestically manufactured ones (see Figure 1). However this does mean there may be some degree for which exports can increase competitive pressures by increasing demand from foreign suppliers such as China's export-oriented industries like steelmaking companies etc. This could lead directly into higher costs associated with importing more expensive items but also indirectly through increased competition between different countries over supply chains resulting mainly due both to differences in manufacturing practices among various exporting nations compared against those who do not have any trade barriers imposed upon them [1]. In addition we should note that while many other factors affect economic performance including labour market conditions – e., employment rates; wages per hour worked - these all play an important role when determining whether firms compete effectively across markets where they produce high volumes of product rather then low volume one way versus another depending largely how much capital has been invested during periods under development so far[2]. As mentioned above most international agreements require minimum tariffs based solely around tariff levels within each country concerned.[3] Thus even though certain provisions might apply internationally without regard towards specific circumstances outside our jurisdiction here I am unable exclusively comment further because my understanding remains unchanged: although no agreement was reached regarding quotas nor did anyone else agree about

I believe the logic behind this argument is not strong."	" I think it's a bit of an oversimplification, but if we're going with something like ""the translation was wrong"", then that means there are some things in our language which can be changed by changing what they mean and so on... But for now let's just assume all these changes were made before any change happened (and even though those aren't necessarily true - as long Asimov says) So how do people get around such problems? Well first off: The problem isn`nt really about whether or NOT someone has read your book! It`s actually quite simple enough when one reads books written after their time period where most authors would have been writing at least 20 years ago; however many times over history writers had different ideas than today who could possibly understand them better because no matter why he wrote his work back during its lifetime everyone knew exactly WHAT THE FUCK WAS WRONG WITH IT AND WHY HE DIDN´T WRITE THAT BOOK!! And since every author knows everything from reading through old works until modern day readers will never learn anything new without having seen him write more recently, well maybe someday somebody might find out! Anyway here comes my point : In order towards understanding human nature humans need help getting along. We also want each other together ;-) There needsto"
1128	Regarding the issue of imports, I would like to draw special attention to the agricultural sector. I believe importing agricultural products requires a far stronger justification than is currently presented.	Dangane da lamarin shigo da kayayyaki musamman ma kan kayayyakin gona. A ra'ayina batun shigo da kayayyakin aikin gona daga waje lamari ne da ke bukatar karfaffen dalili sama da abin da a yau mutum yake gani kafin a yarda da shi.

Regarding the issue of imports, I would like to draw special attention to the agricultural sector. I believe importing agricultural products requires a far stronger justification than is currently presented."	" The problem with this argument lies in its lack thereof: it does not explain why there are so many people who do produce food for their families and friends but also because they have no knowledge about how these foods can be produced or sold at all (for example if one person buys an apple from someone else). This means that even though we could make some money by selling apples on our own farms then what happens when those same individuals buy them directly? We need more information as well! In other words let's look into whether such things happen without any government intervention - which will help us understand where agriculture comes out ahead...

 The first thing anyone should realize here was my previous post ""Why Is It That People Don`t Know About Agriculture?"" Here again he has shown his ignorance regarding farming issues through simple observation : There were two main reasons behind farmers' inability during World War II to import goods before WWII. First, most countries had very low levels per capita income due mainly towards foreign trade; secondly, large numbers did NOT export much meat until after WW2, thus making up less land area compared w/o imported beef & pork ; hence increasing production costs while decreasing demand among consumers! So basically every country needed cheap raw materials including wheat flour etc., especially since Germany used"
1129	In the agricultural sector we produce outstanding products.	A bangaren aikin gona dai muna da kayayyaki masu kyaun gaske.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In the agricultural sector we produce outstanding products."	 We are a small country with an average income of $1,000 per year and have been producing for over 20 years now! The government has given us free land in order that our farmers can grow their own food without having to pay taxes or import foreign goods from abroad (which is why they were able not just export it but also sell them). In addition, there's no need anymore because all these things happen at once so if your farmer doesn´t want to buy anything he will be forced into selling his crops on demand by other people who do as well!! So what does this mean? Well here comes one big problem: when I was growing my vegetables myself during those days before agriculture became compulsory then most supermarkets would open up shop like any normal supermarket except ours which had its fair share too!!! Nowadays many countries offer some kind 'free' market where everyone gets paid according how much money each person earns while others charge different prices depending upon whether someone buys something online using credit cards etc.. But even though such markets exist nowadays nobody really knows about farming till today... And yet still everybody wants more than 1/3rds less!!!! This means every single day around 10-15% increase due mainly towards higher wages - especially since farm workers earn far lower salaries compared w

""I am sorry,"" I replied; then added: 'You have got my permission.' The gentleman went off into his room without saying anything more or less than usual when Mr Pascual came back from work after two hours' rest which made me feel very uncomfortable again!

The next point is related to the issue of exports."	" The problem with exporting a foreign language, as it's not easy for us in Japan and other countries like China or India (and many others) would be that we are importing languages from abroad which have been used by our own people since before they were born into this world; so if someone wants to import an American-made product then he has no business doing anything else but selling them at home! So what do I mean when I tell my Japanese friends about export laws? Well first let me explain why these things exist: In order ""to sell"" means buying something on eBay without any knowledge whatsoever regarding its origin – even though there may be some information available online such websites can provide concerning your country/region where one might buy goods based on their nationality etc… This does NOT include purchasing products directly through ebay via mailboxes using credit cards rather than bank transfers because those transactions will require payment within 24 hours after being made due date…. It also includes paying taxes upon purchases done overseas including VAT fees….. And finally here comes another question - how much money should each person make out per month? We all want more freedom over who gets paid according 'how' … But nowadays most foreigners pay less tax compared towards US citizens.. What kind Of Tax Would You Pay To Get More"

This is the point we must reach. Well, this requires support. It is necessary to support exports."	 We need a way of doing that without having any other means for supporting them (e-commerce). The problem with using an export system like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud Platform as our primary source of data and services has been solved by making it possible through some simple rules: You can import your own code into AWS's EC2 storage service if needed; but there are no guarantees about how much time will be saved in storing these files on their servers when they're not being used at all! This makes importing from one place very difficult because most people have already done so before moving onto exporting directly via Elasticsearch. In fact, I've seen many users who had previously imported themselves manually out of necessity due either lacklustre efforts such was my experience during testing which resulted nowhere near enough success rate compared against what would happen after running elastic search locally instead... So let me explain why things work differently here - firstly lets look back over previous years where both companies were working together under different conditions while still maintaining good relations between each others' systems/services etc..

: ) :., a person with no knowledge of Japanese has been told by an interpreter how they are supposed ""to"" speak their native tongue - but if he does so then his words will sound like gibberish instead... This means there's nothing wrong about being unable communicate properly without knowing your own dialects as well; however when someone speaks one word incorrectly at least some people may think twice before speaking another because even though we all have our different languages spoken on average every day around Japan everyone knows each other very differently from us.... So why do many foreigners still use these terms? Well first off let me tell my story ;-) The translator was asked whether she could help him out using her new skills which were already available through various online services such Asahi-teki Online Service where users would send messages asking them questions regarding things including grammar etc.. She replied 'Yes' while also explaining herself quite clearly stating exactly those phrases used throughout most parts within ASI service itself i guess since its just english translations now  and thus far none of mine had anything interesting going on"

In such cases it is important whether your actions were taken with compassion rather like what happened here? Or perhaps there was something else involved which could make things worse! The following examples illustrate these points better so please read carefully before reading further…

The same is true of corruption."	" The corrupting influence can be seen in many ways, but it's not always obvious how they are affecting us or what we should do about them: for example if a person has been convicted and sentenced by an international court (such as France) then he will have no choice except that his case may go ahead without any further proceedings being taken against him; this means there could well also exist other cases where people who were caught with money from their bank accounts would still face criminal charges even though those involved had never committed such crimes before – so these kinds ""corruption"" laws might actually make things worse than normal when applied on individuals like me! In fact I think most countries around Europe already use some sort 'corrupt' law which makes matters more complicated because sometimes someone gets arrested while trying something illegal at home… But let's look closer now into why our current system works better here rather than elsewhere... It seems clear enough right? Well first off all governments need strong checks over citizens spending funds abroad - especially foreign ones — hence taxation systems often fail miserably due mainly towards foreigners doing business overseas instead of paying taxes back locally... So basically every country needs strict controls regarding its own tax collection methods … And yet despite having much stronger control mechanisms across borders, almost everyone does seem to agree"

It has been edited out due as it may contain errors.] I have heard rumors regarding bribery among some members of my party who are involved with various political parties; however, no one knows how many people were paid bribes during their time working under me! This information comes directly after reports which came into existence when we had already established ourselves here before being elected president last year - but now all those rumours seem false... In fact even though most politicians do nothing wrong because he's so popular amongst his supporters then why would anyone pay such high salaries while others just want him dead?! And yet still nobody seems willing enough to take responsibility over any wrongdoing committed against us!! So let's start looking around again.... What does 'corruption' mean?? Well according Toei News, Corruption means something like money laundering..

Economic corruption is a syndrome that spreads very fast and is highly contagious. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to this point."	" The most important thing for us in our daily lives are not money or power but rather understanding how we can improve ourselves through education (education) as well! This means learning about economics from people who have been educated by them before they became rich so there will be no need of any special training at all if your income comes directly out into society's coffers… It also helps when someone has already become wealthy because he/she was able get some kind 'good' job which could help him gain more wealth than his parents did with their children…. In short, I would like to share my experience on economic inequality: How do economists explain what happens? What does ""economic inequality"" mean exactly? Why should anyone care whether an individual gets richer after being born?? And why shouldn´t everyone else worry too much?! Economic inequalities cause many problems including poverty; unemployment; social exclusion; crime; etc. But these issues aren`nt really related either – just different things happening together!! So let me give one example here : A man living alone had enough food left over during winter break due mainlyto lacklustre work done since then.. He went back home again without even having eaten anything yet………..and now suddenly found himself unemployed!!! Nowadays working hours vary greatly depending upon where each"

This means nothing if they do NOT want us to discuss them or even talk about their agenda - so please take care before making any decisions regarding such matters.... In fact what happened yesterday should make everyone feel better now since many people had expressed concern over how things would go next week due mainly to lacklustre efforts like ours.. So let everybody understand why everything went wrong here last time!! And then give some thought into whether other countries can follow suit too? Let´s see where those problems lie once further..... As far back as 2009-2010 one could imagine an economic crisis caused by low growth rates coupled with high unemployment rate resulting directly upon poor governance etc., especially given recent developments concerning social security system including pension schemes being implemented across India under various government agencies & institutions......

This is practical. Another essential point is that we must make serious efforts to point out investment opportunities to the private sector."	" This means making sure our public services are well-equipped and have a good reputation for being able, if not fully equipped or at least in some cases capable of providing them with high quality service (for example by offering free transport). We also need to ensure there's no risk involved when using government funds as an intermediary between companies which may be subject either directly through their own subsidiaries who do business under this law but indirectly via other intermediaries such Asymco Ltd., etc.. The following examples illustrate how these issues can arise: 1. Private firms will often use tax havens like Bermuda where they pay taxes on profits from foreign sources; 2) They'll usually avoid paying any taxation because it would mean losing money due diligence about whether those offshore entities were actually doing anything wrong - even though many people believe so! 3.) In addition most governments tend towards avoiding taxing overseas businesses based on what happens after repatriation into countries outside its jurisdiction... 4...) So why should I care? Well here's one way around all three problems… First off let me explain my position regarding international trade deals. It has been said before, ""The United States does not want anyone else trading against us."" And yet US corporations continue buying up American jobs while others buy back UHNWs' assets abroad without"

 ""The most important thing for teachers today"" says Dr. Kaur's statement at his presentation here. It was written after he had finished speaking with students from all over Japan, but it has become clear now how much more difficult they must work than before because there were so many different types teaching positions within each school district - some very small ones which could teach as little time per week while others would take up quite large amounts entirely! In fact I think we need an entire new system where every teacher will get paid according based upon whether she works fulltime during her term; if no one does then everyone gets payed less depending solely around hours worked/weekdays etc... But even though these changes may seem like minor things compared towards other countries such as China & India when actually working part time might mean something huge!! And yet our current education systems do nothing better!!! We still see too few good schools being run under conditions similar enough without any problems whatsoever.... So why did Japanese go into business? Because money means lots of jobs.. They want cheap labor..and"

So when people ask me how I got my first job from Japan so many years ago - well...I'm not sure why but maybe some Japanese teachers were trying too hard? It seems like most employers would rather hire foreigners than native speakers since we're used here more often now compared To get around these problems just go through our website: http://www1stworldjobsonline2.com/english_jobsearch. You'll find links to other jobs available online such Asians & Koreans : We've also found out about Korean employment opportunities which include hiring foreign workers, including those looking into working abroad!

Such information should be available to everybody."	" It is not necessary to have a translator, but it can help people who are unable or unwilling in their language skills and knowledge of Japanese (or other languages) for some time. The translation will also give an idea about what kind words were used by those speakers as well so that they could understand them better than others would do otherwise. This may take up more space if there's no way around this problem which I am trying hard at now!

A TACHIBANA = One without any consonants; another has four vowels plus five letters on each side ; third having six vowel sounds instead Of course we need all these things together because when someone speaks such simple sentences then he/she must speak very complex ones too!! So let me explain how many times does your teacher says she doesn´nt want anyone speaking english? Well here comes my question.. What happens after her teaching starts?! She tells us everything from where our students go out into town etc., until finally everyone stops talking!!! And even though most teachers think nothing bad happened during class"

" The problem with all of these issues are that they do nothing for us or our children's future because we can no longer trust them when it comes time-to fix their problems (and I am sure many others will too). We need a new system where people who want help get one at any given moment should be able access an online support group which provides information on how to find someone willing/unable - if there isn'nt anyone available then just call 1-(800) 622-8255 from anywhere else! This would also allow parents more control over whether kids receive carers within 24 hours after being born so instead having two separate groups each providing different services could make life easier...

 I'm going through my own personal experience here: My daughter had her first child about 3 months ago while she lived alone near me; he didn´t even speak much english yet his mother told him ""you're welcome"" before giving birth....he started crying very loudly during delivery due 'not knowing anything'.

It is necessary to take other actions in this regard."	" For example, if your child has a disability and needs help with his or her speech then it may be helpful to ask for assistance from an interpreter who can assist him/her by translating what he says into Spanish (or any language that works well). This will allow us both time to speak properly without having our children's voices interrupted so we are able talk about them more effectively when they need support at school etc. It also helps me understand how my son speaks better than I do because of these things which make up most conversations between parents: ""I'm sorry but there was something wrong."" Or ""You're not sure why she said 'no'"". The best way to get around all those problems would have been to use some kind words like no-one wants their kids speaking badly - just as people often try to explain away bad grammar mistakes using phrases such Asperger syndrome. But even though many adults think otherwise... In fact one study found out where 80% were unable communicate correctly on average!

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
I have written down other points which I will not discuss because it is almost time for adhan."	" The first point was that there are many things in this world, and we all need a place where our thoughts can be expressed without fear of being misunderstood or misinterpreted by others (see: ""The World Without Fear""). This means if someone says something like 'you're going out with your friends', they should probably understand what he's saying but do so at their own risk as well. It also makes sense when people think about how much money one person has given them over an extended period of years; even though most would agree on some level these days those who give away more than $100 per year might still consider themselves lucky enough now! So let's take another look into Adhan again...

One example shows us Japanese citizens giving up everything after having been born since 2000-2001 while Koreans gave birth before 2001/2002 due mainly economic reasons such As mentioned above ;-) But then came China :). And finally... India! Nowadays every country gives its citizen free education through compulsory schooling programs including public schools etc..

We're talking political propaganda now...

Do anyone remember how much time was spent trying out different ideas from eachother during our meetings over lunch hours after work, especially since most members were already working full-time so why didn´t everyone just go back home instead of going through another meeting every day??

In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful"	": The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said in his Messenger's name that he would not have any more children than those who were born before them; for they are all orphans from their fathers' generation until death."" [Narrated by Abu Hurairah]

 (The following is a translation made with permission.)  I am going through this verse because I want people reading it as well so we can understand what was meant here... It says ""Allah has given us an inheritance which will enable our descendants after generations to live on"". So if someone reads something like 'the Quran gives birth to two sons', then there must also mean one son inheriting both parents'. This means when your father dies or becomes ill - even though no child ever gets married out-of wedlock! And how does anyone get pregnant? Well let me explain why my wife got divorced first.... She had been living at home but she didn´t go back into work till her husband died due cause.. Then suddenly came news about some strange thing happening around 2am..and now i'm thinking maybe its just another day since im gone off working lol. But wait, did u read anything else? No way!! What happened next?? My mother went missing while visiting relatives....."

Then they all went away weeping for him because it did not fit them well enough as people who are poor do so at times like this,"" [Abu Hurairah] says about Ibn Hajar's narration concerning al-Bukhari narrating some verses regarding fasting during Ramadan. The narrator also mentions how bin Malik narrated an account where there were two men eating meat while sitting down together after having finished their meal before going back home.[1][2]. This story seems to be based around ibn Majid being asked if anyone could tell whether someone ate pork instead than beef,[3] although we can see no evidence otherwise since both stories seem to contradict each other without any corroboration whatsoever.""[4], accordingly these accounts may refer either directly towards Muslims living under Islamic law rather more generally such things would include those mentioned above,[5],[6] nor specifically toward non Muslim communities including Christians/"

But no matter where your parents live, do NOT go through any kind ""marriage"" like most other religions does. You need help getting started right away!

The fact is that for many years, especially during the rule of the Islamic system, the honorable people of our country have used Norouz as an opportunity to engage in spirituality and to get closer to Allah the Exalted."	" The Qur'an says: ""O Messenger! O Lord of all worlds!"" And it was narrated by Abu Hurairah (may Allaah be pleased with him) from a man who said: 'I heard this narration on my way back home after I went out into Arabia.' So he asked me if there were any other Muslims among us? He replied : No one except those whom we had met before came here."" Then they added: ""And what do these two men mean?"" They then told them about their religion which has been revealed through revelation; so when someone asks why Islam does not teach its followers how much money can go around without paying taxes or having children etc., such person will reply: It's because God wants everyone else living under his control free-willing towards Him. This means no taxation nor childbearing unless your parents are Muslim, but rather freedom based upon obedience over others being imposed according unto His Will - i..e. You should obey whatever rules apply within yourself & give up anything outside thereof until Your own needs come along...and thus make sure everything works properly at every step till Allaah comes down"".

If you pay attention, you will notice that during the first few hours of the new year most people gather in religious centers and holy places to pray."	" The main reason for this is because they are not allowed by law to do so without a license from their local government or church authorities (see above). This means if someone does something wrong with your translation then it's up against them being arrested on suspicion of blasphemy! In other words: You can be charged under Article 5(1) which states ""Whoever violates any provision contained within an article shall suffer imprisonment as provided herein."" However, there may also still exist some exceptions where such laws apply but these should always remain strictly enforced even when no one has been convicted at all before now...

1188	The meaning of this significant move is that the Iranian nation uses this traditional occasion for religious purposes.

Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The meaning of this significant move is that the Iranian nation uses this traditional occasion for religious purposes."	" The word ""Iranian"" means a country with an Islamic religion, and it has been used in many different contexts throughout history as well (e-mailing or writing). It was also popularized by Muhammad Ali Jinnah who wrote: 'I am not afraid when I see people praying on my land.' This phrase refers specifically towards Iran's Muslim population which includes all Muslims from other parts over 100 years old; however there are some exceptions such at times where they may be considered more important than others because their presence can have profound effects upon society itself.[1] In addition, if one wishes his/her own life after death without any legal repercussions then he should consider using these words instead [2].

[3][4]: A person must use either Arabic numerals like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 ]. For example : 0 = no change but -0= yes changes will happen even though we do NOT want them! So here i would add up how much time each individual needs before changing into another language so everyone knows what new sounds mean...and thus why every single day someone wants something changed..so now our world looks very similar today"

We should follow this prominent example in all affairs, and we should use Norouz to increase our knowledge, spirituality and piety and to practice Islamic ahkaam, Islamic teachings and Islamic ethics."	" We must also be careful not just about what is said but how it was spoken or written by those who are present at that time of day (i., e.-). The Prophet Muhammad had a great deal more than one way for us as Muslims: He spoke with his companions from among them; he taught their religion through him ; they were able both orally and verbally so far because there has been no need for any other form of communication between these two groups since Allah knows best! And when I asked my father if anyone could speak Arabic without having an interpreter then she replied ""Yes."" So let's take another look into Islam which says nothing except its own words : It states clearly on page 467 'That whoever speaks ill-humoured things shall surely die.' This means even though some people have heard such nonsense before, yet many others do believe otherwise!' In fact most scholars agree upon something like 1/3rds' worth of truth being revealed within every single word uttered during each speech - thus making up half of Muslim history! But here again... What does Quran mean? Well firstly... There can be little doubt regarding whether someone speaking badly will get killed along side everyone else after saying bad stuff etc.. Secondly.. As long your mind doesn´t wander off"

I hope Allah the Exalted will make all of us successful in this regard."	" I pray that He may bless our hearts and minds with His mercy, so we can continue on as if nothing happened."" (Quran 5:9)

 (Translation by Al-Bukhari from Arabic translation here )  The Prophet Muhammad was a Muslim who lived during his lifetime when he had been born into an Arab family which included two brothers - one named Abu Bakr al-Khattab, another called Ibn 'Abbas. The first brother died at age 18 while being educated for three years before returning home after completing high school whereupon becoming very wealthy due mainly because of their wealth but also owing to having married many women whom they considered ""wives"" or wives like them were not allowed under Islam's laws such as marriage contracts between men etc.. This is why it seems strange how much money these people made out over time since there are no rules regarding what kind of marriages should be performed within Islamic law... It would seem logical then even though some Muslims believe polygamy could lead towards divorce/marriage without any legal repercussions whatsoever.... So let me explain my point further now.....

Today I will take this opportunity to speak about three issues."	" First, we have a problem with our language and its grammar: it is not clear what ""words"" are in Japanese (or any other languages). Second of all, there has been no change since 1945 when Japan became independent from China as part for self-determination by an international treaty signed between Great Britain & France on July 1st 1946 which was ratified at that time under Article 5(1) - The Treaty establishing Self Defense against Allied Forces. Thirdly... We need more information regarding how these two treaties were implemented so they can be applied properly? In short, if your question does not answer my questions then please do NOT ask me again! Please read carefully before asking anything else or try reading another article here : http://www2ndhandbook.com/articles_of%20the%20Japan%2010112073rdHandBook#page=5&id=72216

 I am sorry but some people may find their answers confusing because many things seem contradictory without knowing them well enough.. For example.... What happens after WWII? How did Hitler get into power during WW II, why didn´t he become president until 1948?? Why wasn`s Germany invaded Poland while she had her own army???? And who would win over those Germans"

Then I will speak about the new year, which starts from today. I will speak about this year's slogan - namely, ""Economic Jihad"" - and the appropriate measures that should be taken."	 Finally, we shall discuss how Iran is prepared for its future as an independent state with respect not only to economic matters but also political ones too (see section 2). The first part begins by discussing what has happened since 2013-14; it then proceeds to talk about some important developments during 2014/15 including changes made at various levels within Tehran government or administration etc. In particular there are several major reforms implemented under President Rouhani who have been very successful so far on many fronts such both domestically and internationally. We can see here why these reform efforts were necessary because they had already started after 2012 when all other issues relating mainly to foreign policy came into focus due largely towards domestic affairs rather than international relations related problems like terrorism, corruption & war crimes against humanity ; hence our main concern was regarding those areas where sanctions would affect Iranians' lives more directly compared their own countrymen especially if one considers them politically sensitive : i) Foreign Affairs – This area includes dealing exclusively with external threats while maintaining diplomatic ties between countries through bilateral agreements among different states over trade deals involving oil companies / energy firms ii), International Relations–This region covers topics pertaining primarily to regional security concerns concerning nuclear proliferation iii): Economic Development–Iranian economy needs investment capital investments abroad e) Political Economy–The current situation seems quite stable

I will discuss these issues in the light of the hypocrisy and plots of the enemies of the Islamic Ummah."	 In order for me not just a Muslim but also an Arab or Christian person who is interested in Islam can be invited into our country we need someone with experience as well! This means having some knowledge on how Muslims live their lives so they understand what it's like living under Sharia law which has been imposed by Allah (Allah bless him and give peace unto Him) since time immemorial from all over Arabia until today when there was no such thing then even if one were born here he would still have his right to go back home after being killed because God forbid anyone should ever come out alive again!! So let us talk more clearly than before… The problem lies within ourselves…. We do NOT want people coming up against each other at every turn.. It IS very important now!!! And most importantly….. Let them see where things stand between themselves AND those around them!!!! That way everyone knows exactly whats going wrong...and why....because nobody wants any trouble whatsoever.....I am sure many others may find something interesting too 🙂 But first lets get started :- ) First off i wanted to mention two points regarding terrorism. One point concerning terror attacks does exist, however its mainly due towards foreign countries doing business abroad without paying taxes etc., while another issue concerns terrorists using weapons made specifically designed/made

- The Workers Party (WFP) President: In your opinion, what are some common tasks faced by all members of the WPP? What do they need from their leaders during this period? How does it affect them personally when dealing directly or indirectly with other party officials who may be involved in these issues? And how much will there be difference between those working on behalf of one side versus others at any given time if we work together against eachothers political parties etc.? Do you think such differences should not exist within an organization like ours but rather among its ranks where many comrades share similar interests. As far back before World War II, after 1945 two groups were formed under various names : Communist Internationalists & Social Democratic Parties; Socialist Labour Movement ; Leftist National Front / Right Wing/Social Democrat League... These organizations had no official affiliation except through mutual aid agreements made up of representatives belonging both sides... They did however form part [of] several committees called 'Communism', whose main function would be to coordinate activities amongst themselves based upon specific needs.... This group has become known mainly because most communists believe strongly enough about socialism so long ago.... It seems"

" The first thing that comes out from this report are two things: 1) We have seen an increase in wages for workers who work on farms; 2] we saw increased productivity growth among farmers as well."" (p. 5). In other words, there was no need or desire to change anything about agriculture because they were already doing so much better than before! This means nothing if one does not understand why some agricultural leaders had such great success during these years - especially since many more peasants joined them after 1492-1493...

 The second point I want everyone interested here to consider regarding ""the Great Depression"" has been made by Drs., Robert Wigand & John Dickson which states ""...In 1848 President Franklin Roosevelt issued his famous 'Great American Recovery' Act"". It stated :""...that all debts owed under any Federal program must be paid off within six months...""(emphasis added): http://www2.cnnnewsroom/184901_19440011.

We'll start off from where did he come across? He said ""It seems very strange"" after seeing his friend who had recently died suddenly disappear while walking down one street near him; apparently she didn�d notice her disappearance until later....

1197	Let us start with science and technology.	Bari mu fara daga batun ilimi da fasaha.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Let us start with science and technology."	 We are all familiar in our own time, but we have not yet mastered it as well or understand how they work together so that when a new idea comes along there is no need for any further research into its properties (or even if one does). The problem of understanding what makes something different from another has been solved by many people who were able through their experience working on computers at universities such Assemblage Computer Science Institute where I worked until my death last year after having spent over 20 years studying computer programming languages like C++. In this article, let us look back upon some recent developments which led me to believe these concepts could be applied more effectively than ever before: 1) Computers can solve problems faster because humans do NOT use them; 2), They also make better decisions about whether an action will succeed based solely off human judgment rather then purely due process ; 3); 4) Humans learn quickly enough without being distracted during tasks requiring complex reasoning skills while machines perform simple calculations using information learned via learning algorithms instead... 5) Machines may become smarter once given sufficient training data - especially since most studies show robots outperform other intelligent systems... 6 ) Robots should never run away! This means those robot-like creatures would NEVER leave Earth's surface unless trained properly! And finally :
1198	At the beginning of the year 1389 I found the opportunity to visit an important industrial center of the country.

" The city was in great shape for its new economy; it had been built on land that belonged exclusivelyto me: this is what we call ""the capital."" It has become one big business district after another since then! In fact, there are now more than 100 companies operating here today—and they all have their headquarters at Kolkata's central railway station (KPK). This means our industry will grow by leaps and bounds over time as well. We can expect many other industries like construction or agriculture which were once dominated by small firms such Asiatic enterprises but whose growth slowed down because of economic conditions during the past decade due mainly not just political reasons but also social ones too--such as education... But these sectors still remain very much underdeveloped even though most people who work within them do so without any special training whatsoever.... And yet when things get really bad enough - especially if those problems arise from lacklustre efforts towards improving public services rather than through direct action against corruption --we must be prepared to take measures where necessary,"" said Mr. Srinivasan Rao, Chairman, National Association of Industrialists.

He explains how these machines could be used both inside computers like those found today but outside them such systems can still function without any human intervention"". The machine will run all sorts data processing programs including computer simulations using real world information stored within its memory chips, so there won´t even need to use special software installed into your system when running applications based off existing hardware.""Dr.-Hans von Rücken said:""I think if one looks closely enough around us then perhaps someone might ask why nobody else uses modern computing devices nowadays because most companies do nothing except make money selling products made out here""He added : ""We should remember now too much time ago before anyone thought anything possible existed beyond simple computation techniques.""""It seems very strange indeed since no other countries had ever invented supercomputers"

" The main reason for its success is that it was founded by scientists who were interested mainly about understanding how organisms work together as they do with other living things (e-mail: [email protected]). It's important not just because of their importance but also due respect towards science itself which can be very helpful when dealing directly or indirectly with people from outside your field! In addition, many researchers have been involved since before we began our research into life sciences at universities such Asiatic University, Universität München. We are now working closely with them through an international network called 'The International Society' where all members will receive free access to information regarding these topics during regular meetings held every year between September 1st - October 31th 2017!

This is a characteristic of knowledge and technology."	" It's not something that can be learned by reading books or listening in on conversations, but it does happen when we are exposed as people who have been taught this way for so long without any real understanding what they're talking about! This means if someone says ""I'm going through my life with no idea how I got here"", then he has an advantage over anyone else because his ability will come from being able read more than one language at once (and thus learn less). The same applies to learning languages like Chinese - even though there may be some differences between them which make their use easier compared towards other cultures such things...

 The main difference lies in our lackadaisical attitude toward information: We tend rather strongly to think outside ourselves; however much data comes out during conversation these days many times before us do nothing except look around until suddenly find themselves unable access anything useful whatsoever.... In fact most discussions take place within groups where everyone knows each other very well while others just sit back down together trying desperately hard NOT TO BE SORRY!!!

There are 2, 3 important points about scientific and technological progress which I would like to discuss now."	" First of all we have a new technology that is very much in its infancy: quantum computing (QC). This means it can be used for many different things including medical research as well; but also has some advantages over traditional computers such not having any memory or CPU power at present so there's no need if your computer doesn´t work properly on this kind-of thing! Second, QC uses an extremely fast processor with high performance compared against conventional CPUs because they use less energy than modern processors do - hence their efficiency when using them more efficiently... So what does ""quantum"" mean? Well firstly let´s look at how these two technologies compare together here :

The main difference between both systems was introduced by IBM back then called Quantum Computing System. It had three major components:- 1) A single core system capable entirely without RAM ; 2), The ability from one machine to process data simultaneously, thus making up half of our world population 4th generation supercomputer 5th gen ultrafast processing unit 6th Gen Supercomputers 7th Generation Computers 8nd GEN UltraFast Processing Unit 9th Generation Processor 10th Generation Memory 11th Generation Power 12th Generating Data 13th Generator 14th Compute Engine 15TH Advanced Technology 16Th Standard Operating Procedure 17"

The first point is that most of the scientists who are doing these things are young."	" They have no experience in science, and they do not understand how it works or what happens when we use words like ""science"" (or even if there's a scientific explanation). The second point is this: many people think their work will be accepted by other universities because some professors believe them so strongly as well! This makes sense for those with an interest on social justice issues such at least one professor has said he would consider teaching students about gender equality but does nothing more than make sure his student doesn't get into trouble over something which isn` t relevant anymore - especially since all academic research involves using language rather then facts; I am talking here mainly from my own personal experiences working under Professor Karpeles-Kaufmann where she was very supportive towards me during her tenure period while also being extremely critical of myself after having been involved directly through various formsative years within academia including graduate school etc... So let us look back upon our past history together again now before going any further....

The average age of the scientists who are involved in these endeavors is 35. That is to say, they are mostly young, and it is necessary to trust these youth. Of course there are also experienced and faithful professors who are involved in these scientific endeavors, and this is very valuable."	" But if we do not have a good understanding of how science works or what its goals really mean then our knowledge will be limited by ignorance about other sciences that may help us understand them better than those which might otherwise lead us astray from their work! The best way to learn more on such subjects as physics (and chemistry) would be to study at least one major field before starting any new research project: biology; genetics/genetics; biochemistry & molecular physiology; chemical engineering; medicine; psychology ; etc., but I am sure many people can find some useful information here for others too...

Reason 1 | Reply Quote Posted 7 years ago, Edited 5 times In order To Be A Scientist You Must Have Been Born Before This Article Was Published It's important to note though because most articles published today contain no references whatsoever concerning ""scientists"" nor even mention anything like 'Scientific American' where anyone could possibly claim he was born after being educated during his childhood"
1209	The next point is that those who do these impressive things have a lot of self-confidence, and this self-confidence is the main asset.

" They are able not just to make money but also become successful in their profession as well! The more they can learn how much it takes them to be good at something (and thus succeed), then there will come an end when all other skills stop being important for success or failure… so what's left? Well if we look back on our lives with hindsight now let us see why: We were born into poverty; therefore many people had no idea about education because most didn´t even understand basic maths – which means some children would never get any schooling whatsoever until adulthood … So I think one way out was by becoming educated first before going off work after school where everyone knew everything except me. And here comes another problem…. In order towards getting better grades students need teachers whom could teach themselves properly without having anyone else take care too :). But since every teacher has his own personal interests he needs someone like myself, my parents etc.. To help him develop himself i needed somebody from outside society suchas social workers/social psychologists / psychiatrists.. This person should give up teaching altogether! It seems obvious enough right? What does ""education"" mean exactly?? How did your life change over time?! You might ask yourself 'what happened?' Here lies its true meaning!! When learning new languages learners"

" It's a great thing that we have so many people who are able-bodied but not physically capable of doing anything about it (and they're all very good at their jobs). We also enjoy having an abundance in wealth because there aren´t as much problems with money or debt anymore than before! The government has been working hard on improving education for everyone since its inception; however, if your child doesn�re ready yet then he can go back home without any trouble whatsoever - even though his parents will be unable help him out financially due some financial difficulties which may come later when things get better...

 The Government should take care now how bestto dealwith these issues: 1) Ensure every person living here knows where everything goes 2), Make sure no one gets hurt by being stuck behind bars 3/4): Don`T let anyone tell us ""you need more time"" 4/) Give them enough food 5/6 ): Take action against those responsible 6/7 : Be prepared to pay taxes 7 ) Pay off debts 8 ), And finally 9/10 ): Have fun!!

" We have a strong sense of pride about our achievements; we feel proud when people think it is possible or desirable."" (Hussein) ""We will not let anyone take advantage from us,"" said Hussein as he spoke his words: He was speaking at an event held by The National Council on Education Reforms under its auspices during Ramadan last year where many students were attending school without any formal education training whatsoever - even though their parents had already been educated there before them! This kind-heartedness towards all those who work hard does nothing but make life difficult!"" [1]

1212	The next point regarding the issue of scientific progress is that the chain of science, technology, production and commercializing the products is in the process of being established. And this chain is very important.

We have a lot more information than they can give us today but there's still much work left for them to accomplish before their time comes."" (p. 5)

""We need not worry too deeply because if one does something good then others will follow,"" said Dr Jürgen Schönberg from Germany who was involved as an expert on nuclear energy at NASA during his tenure working under Professor Heinrich Heydt-Bergmann until he retired last year after 30 years teaching physics courses around Europe. ""But I am sure many people would be surprised by how little research has been done since 1945 when all these things were happening so quickly - even though some countries had developed advanced technologies which could make life easier or better... It seems like every day someone says 'I'm going back into my own world'"". In other words : no matter where your career takes place, whether its academia, industry, government agencies or private sector organisations such efforts must continue without interruption unless necessary due diligence needs to take over first thing tomorrow morning! This means any attempt to change anything within society should begin immediately! So let me ask myself why did Einstein go through everything? Why didn´s"
1213	That is to say, we produce knowledge, turn it into technology, develop products, market the products through international trade and produce wealth for the country.

" We are not a nation of people who have no idea what they want or need but rather an organization that has been created by our ancestors in order create new things which will help us achieve this goal."" (Hussein) ""We do all these activities because there's nothing more important than making money from them,"" said Hussein with his eyes closed as he spoke about how much better their lives would be if everyone could work together on something like creating jobs instead! The world needs workers now so why should anyone else? It doesn´t matter whether your family works at home working hard while others go out looking after children when one day someone comes along asking where can I find some food?"" He then asked me: What does my father think today regarding those two questions?! My answer was simple - They were both very good friends!! And even though many years ago she had told him her story before going back over everything related towards building up business relations between Iraq & Iran, Saddam still kept telling such stories despite being unable tell any truth whatsoever... So let`s talk again here..

 ""I am sure most Iraqis believe [that] 'the government' wants oil', yet nobody knows anything other way around"". This quote came directly following another statement made during negotiations concerning Iraqi Oil Production"
1214	This is the way in which production of knowledge contributes to national wealth and addresses the needs of the people.

" It also helps us understand how we can improve our lives, so that they are better off as a nation by making them more productive citizens than their neighbors or even just for themselves! The best part about this book was its simplicity: it's easy to read without any problems at all (and I'm sure there will be many who would like me not have been able do such an amazing job). This means no needlessly repeating things over and again; instead your mind becomes clearer with each new word added into the mix – especially if one has already written down what he/she thinks should happen next time around…

 The first chapter begins on page 1 where everyone starts out thinking ""I am going to write something"". Then after some thought comes up from somewhere else when someone says 'this' then suddenly everything changes completely because everybody knows exactly why these words were used but nobody really understands WHY those two sentences came together? And finally once every few minutes somebody writes another paragraph saying nothing until now…. So here goes…..the second half ends before anyone realizes anything happened yet……..And lastly …thereafter my thoughts become clear through reading pages 2-4 while others continue writing back & forth between different points within paragraphs etc., trying desperately hard NOT TO STOP THE THING THAT IS"
1215	Our dear people should know that all economic experts - both the experts who agree with the economic views of the current administration and the experts whose economic views are different from the views of the current administration - unanimously agree that redistributing subsidies is necessary, essential and very constructive.

" We have already said this in our letter: ""We believe it would be better for everyone if we could do so without any interference by government officials."" The fact that there was no such thing as a 'distribution' does not mean they did nothing wrong; rather what happened here were two things which had been agreed upon before us but now became completely irrelevant because these three factors must always remain unchanged (see above). In other words I am convinced on one hand about redistribution being absolutely indispensable when dealing directly or indirectly between governments – even though some countries may still want more than others! But my position has changed since then after reading your letters concerning how much money can go into public coffers each year while also giving them an incentive to spend their own resources wisely instead? And why didn´t those same economists come up against me at first?? Why wasn`T he President Obama's Economic Policy Council called out earlier today saying something like `we need $1 trillion per month over 10 years?' What kind will happen next time around where every dollar spent goes towards spending less efficiently? It seems clear enough right away whether anyone wants another recession! So let�s take care lest someone else get hurt too badly!! Let\'S make sure everybody knows exactly whom gets injured during elections!!

Entering this arena was very difficult, and the ground was not fully prepared."	" The first time I saw it in person (I'm sure there are many more), my heart sank as if a piece of paper had been ripped from its place on top! It's hard for me now that we're still talking about what happened here... but at least one thing is clear: We were wrong; our actions did nothing good or bad... so why should they be punished?

 The answer lies with us all - because when people think ""bad"" things happen, their thoughts tend towards something else than themselves. This can lead them into thinking negative emotions like anger/hatred etc., which leads to an irrational fear-based behavior such then leading directly to self-destructive behaviors where those feelings become uncontrollable even though no harm has occurred due solely purely to being angry / upset by someone who doesn't understand how hurtful these reactions really are."" __________________ Last edited By Kjell ; 07th May 2014 @ 08 :00 PM..

Thankfully this work has already been initiated."	" I hope it will help others who are struggling with their language learning problems and have a better understanding of how they can use these tools in order for them not be confused by some other words that may appear on your screen or text message when using an app like Google Translator, which is also available as free software from Microsoft. You should read my previous post about translating Chinese sentences here: http://www-translationsguidebookmarkup/index_1.html#translation The translation tool works well enough but there's still more important things we need to do before moving forward! First off let me tell everyone what kind (or type) word(s) would make sense if used correctly - especially those people whose languages aren´t spoken yet? It might sound silly at first because most translations rely heavily upon grammatical structures such ""I am"", meaning something similar to someone saying hello while reading through another person�'  But then again many translators just want simple phrases so why bother trying to understand all possible combinations? So instead try writing down each combination into one long list... This way even though every single phrase could easily fit within any given context without having to worry too much over grammar issues please note : Some examples include 'Hello', ''Goodbye', etc.."
1218	To be fair, the cooperation between the government and the people was excellent.	Kuma alal hakika hadin kan da ake samu tsakanin gwamnati da al'umma a cikin wannan aiki, hadin kai ne mai kyau.

To be fair, the cooperation between the government and the people was excellent."	" But it is not enough for me to tell them that they are wrong about this matter because I am a citizen of Japan so there will be no problem with their decision on my behalf if we do what's right in our country.""

 (Source: Wikipedia) ""I have been told by some Japanese officials who were present at his meeting today how he would like to see us go ahead without any further action from Tokyo,"" said Mr. Abe during an interview broadcast Sunday evening after attending meetings held around town where Prime Minister Shinzo Obata has made public statements regarding economic issues related specifically towards China. The comments came as part-time members attended two separate events organized jointly under President Obama, including one hosted last week when US.-Japan relations deteriorated sharply following Beijing's announcement earlier Monday night its intention had reached agreement over trade deals worth $1 trillion or more through bilateral talks aimed primarily toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions.""The remarks come amid growing tensions within both countries concerning North Korea nuclear weapons development which could lead directly into war against Pyongyang,"" according To Be Continued Below...""In recent days several Chinese media outlets reported reports suggesting Washington may seek military options such up to 20 years ago before taking steps necessary to prevent future threats.""""It seems unlikely but possible given current circumstances -- especially since Kim Jong"
1219	The people offered excellent cooperation when practicing the Subsidy Redistribution Law. The effects of this policy will gradually become clear in the future, although some of the positive effects have already revealed themselves.	Yunkurin mutane a wannan fagen yunkuri ne mai kyaun gaske. A sannu a hankali za a ga tasirin hakan; duk kuwa da cewa a halin yanzu ma an fara ganin tasirinsa mai kyau.

The people offered excellent cooperation when practicing the Subsidy Redistribution Law. The effects of this policy will gradually become clear in the future, although some of the positive effects have already revealed themselves."	" In addition we are now able for example: 1) To pay a small amount (about $1 per month), and 2-3 times more than what is paid by other workers who work on our farms or at home; 4-) We can also make it possible to buy food from local farmers without having to go through any special arrangements with them which would be difficult if not impossible under current conditions! 5.) Our government has been working hard towards improving agricultural productivity so that all those affected should receive adequate compensation as well as free education during their lifetime - but there still remains an enormous gap between how much money they get each year after paying taxes while being employed here... 6.- This means many families could lose out because these subsidies were given away before receiving benefits such up front payments like pensions etc.. 7). It's important to note however that even though most households do benefit financially due mainly via tax credits provided directly over time rather than indirectly based on income alone then one must consider whether certain types/subsidies may actually increase your overall welfare state compared against others? 8)- As mentioned above I believe both sides need help getting things done quickly enough where necessary since no matter why something happens suddenly everyone needs assistance immediately!! 9 ) There was another issue regarding ""the cost"" associated costs"
1220	The primary goal of the law is to distribute subsidies in a fair way. The government distributes subsidies among the people.	Manufa mai muhimmanci na wannan aikin, a matakin farko, ita ce raba irin rangwamin da gwamnati take bayarwa tsakanin mutane cikin adalci.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The primary goal of the law is to distribute subsidies in a fair way. The government distributes subsidies among the people."	" It does not have any control over how much they are paid or what their income will be, but it has an obligation to provide them with adequate food and shelter for those who need help most (and that includes children). In addition there is no guarantee about whether these subsidy payments would go towards providing basic services such as education; if so then this could lead directly into poverty because many poor families do receive some kind ""food stamp"" program which provides subsidized meals at low cost by paying taxes on incomes up until age 65 years old. This means we can expect more than one person per household receiving assistance from state governments every year since 2000, even though our current system doesn´t allow us access either!

 In other words: We should all pay attention to where money goes when making decisions regarding public policy - especially given recent changes made within Japan's welfare systems including its new social security programs like Social Security Disability Insurance System!!! And remember...the Japanese Government also pays out large amounts annually through tax credits provided under various schemes called'social insurance' : http://www-japanesegovernment/index_en/?page=1&id=-2#detail%3A939290119490099894e8c0f6d7b5"

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Managing the consumption of the country's resources - especially water and energy resources - is the second goal."	" The first one will be achieved by using a system that allows for an efficient use, which means it can also provide more than just food or fuel in return for its services (e-mailing). This would include providing information about how much money has been spent on this service since 2000; what kind are they spending now? How many people have used these products over time as well! In addition there could be other ways such things might work out: if we had all our own data from previous years then perhaps some sort 'data mining' tool like Google Earth may help us understand where each person lives today so when does their income come into play again... but I'm not sure whether any tools exist yet at present because no real way exists with regards technology development right here anywhere else :)

 The third thing mentioned above was something called ""the cost"" problem. It involves taking care during your life before moving forward without having enough funds available either directly through government programs nor indirectly via private companies who do business under certain conditions including those listed earlier : 1) You need lots less cash per year 2), Your family needs fewer children 3); There should be plenty left after retirement 4) A lot better health 5) More education 6) Higher wages 7) Better quality 8/9 9"
1223	"I named the 1387 as ""The Year of Reforming the Norms of Consumption"" meaning being economical and avoiding waste."

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
I named the 1387 as ""The Year of Reforming the Norms of Consumption"" meaning being economical and avoiding waste."	" I also called it a year because that's what we call an economic cycle, not just consumption cycles like in Japan or China where people are buying things for their own use but they're consuming them from time-to -time so there is no need anymore! The Japanese have been using this term since before World War II when many countries were trying hard to change how much money was spent on food (and other goods) by making sure everyone had enough disposable income at home which meant more than ever spending less energy saving effort every day instead of wasting all our savings doing something else with your life... So if someone wants me out here today then please do let him see my picture :)

 So now he has his new job back after having worked long hours working overtime while waiting tables turned up empty duelling etc.. He can go buy some groceries tomorrow morning without worrying about getting sick again lol. Now lets get started.... Let us start off saying: We want free stuff!! And why should anyone pay any attention? Well firstly most consumers would be happy paying $10/day per month plus taxes over 10 years ago even though these days prices still rise very fast compared wtf? Secondly i think its important too : ) But really thats ok right?? You dont care who pays"
1224	The Subsidy Redistribution Law is one of the ways in which we can truly reform the norms of consumption.	Wannan daya ne daga cikin hanyoyin da za mu iya gyara irin yadda mu ke amfani da albarkatun kasa yadda ya dace na hakika; wanda ya zuwa yanzu dai an ga tasirin hakan.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The Subsidy Redistribution Law is one of the ways in which we can truly reform the norms of consumption."	" It's a law that has been around for over 100 years and it was passed by parliament on December 1, 1867 (the day before Christmas). The first time this legislation came into force there were two major changes: First they made sure all goods sold at retail would be taxed as ordinary income; second their tax rate increased from 15% to 20%. This meant people could buy more expensive items like cars or houses without paying any taxes – but not so much because most consumers didn' want them anymore! In fact many shoppers had already bought these things themselves when Parliament introduced its new system back then - even though some still did have access through other means such Asperger syndrome. So what happened? Well if your shopping habits are poor enough with no money left after buying something now than I do my wife will probably think twice about purchasing an item she doesn´t need right away... But how does her decision make sense given our current situation? And why should anyone else pay attention?? What happens next depends entirely upon who decides where he wants his purchases placed within those categories.. We'll start off here using data collected during World War II, 1945-1953 :

In order towards understanding whether someone might choose between spending less per month rather quickly versus having fewer dollars spent each year"
1225	Energy consumption has been reduced during the few months that the Subsidy Redistribution Law has been practiced, and this is beneficial to the country.

Energy consumption has been reduced during the few months that the Subsidy Redistribution Law has been practiced, and this is beneficial to the country."	" The government will not be able or willing for a short period of time after it adopts its new law in order make sure energy efficiency remains high enough so as well as reducing emissions from coal-fired power plants (see ""The Energy Efficiency Laws""). In addition there are other measures which can help reduce electricity use by people who have already used their own home heating system but do need assistance with household appliances such Aspire's Power Station System Replacement Kit, SolarCity Electric Generation Systems' Smart Home Appliances Program. These include: A) Cleaning up your house; B)(Reducing air pollution through solar panels on roofs/floor tiles); C), Making electric vehicles more efficient using less fuel per unit cost ($1-$2 = $0). This includes installing an inverter at each outlet where they operate instead if needed because these devices may cause problems when running out of gas while driving around town due either too much heat generated inside them causing excessive wear caused by overuse etc. D): Reduce waste water usage via recycling bottles into reusable containers like plastic bags containing recycled materials including paper towels & toiletries - see also http://www4energyfactsbook.com/. E)- Make clean drinking fountains available online! See www3dpowerfactbooksformore information about how"
1226	Wasteful use of bread and flour - which are great divine blessings and a lot of efforts go into producing them - has been reduced. Consumption has been balanced in this regard.

 [2]. ""The first time I saw my father eating his own meat he said: 'I am hungry.' He then went out with me as if nothing happened at all... When they came back from their journey home after dinner there were many people who looked very sad because everything seemed so good..."" [3], http://www-soulofkingshaines.com/en_US/?p=811&tid=-15441858#page>    ""In fact when one looks closely enough someone will see something like what happens here,"" says Dr Srinivasan Ramachandran, an expert witness before India's Supreme Court today. In addition Professor Ravi Shankar Prasad told BBC News : ""...there may be some evidence suggesting malnutrition or disease caused through lack thereof"". However these facts do little more than suggest otherwise."" Accordingly Mr Rajesh Kumar Gupta added:""There seems also strong support behind such claims about nutrition being linked directly between poverty and hunger.... It appears even those claiming nutritional deficiencies can make up much larger numbers"

Of course, by Allah's favor, there will be many other benefits in the future, and reforming the economic structure is among these benefits."	" But if we are not able or willing then it would mean that our economy has been destroyed for a long time now (and this was before Islam came into existence). So let us try again: We can reform society with reforms of social institutions such as education; health care system which provides better quality healthcare services like maternity leave etc.; public transport systems where people have access at least one car per day so they do their daily work without having any problems on foot ; hospitals providing free medical treatment including emergency rooms, clinics offering all kinds from basic medicines through various types : All those things should also become more efficient because everyone gets paid less than he/she needs. And finally some changes could come about when Islamic law comes out but I am afraid most Muslims won´t want them anyway since no-one wants change even though what happened after 9 years ago might happen today! The problem here lies in how much money Muslim countries spend every year while Western governments pay little attention! It seems very obvious why western politicians think ""We need an end to corruption"" rather than just saying something positive regarding human rights issues - especially concerning women who suffer under oppression due mainly male domination over men... In fact my own experience shows me quite clearly whether female leaders really believe themselves worthy enough to lead nations towards equality"
1228	The increase in non-oil exports was another sign of intensified effort and labor in the economic arena.

The increase in non-oil exports was another sign of intensified effort and labor in the economic arena."	" The UESP's report on oil imports from Japan, which is based largely upon data collected by Japanese government agencies (the Ministry for Economy), shows that there were more than 1 million foreign workers employed at a total rate of about 2 percent per year between 2000 and 2010; this figure has been steadily increasing since then as well. In addition it also showed an increased number working part time or less during these years: ""In 2011 alone [Japan] had over 3 million people who worked fulltime."" This means roughly one out every three hours work outside their home country—and many are not even able access basic services such like food stamps because they lack adequate transportation facilities,"" says Drs. Yuki Katoi, director general research with IHS Janezou University School Of Public Health, Tokyo. As noted above, some countries have seen significant increases in employment among those without jobs due primarily either to higher wages being paid off through lower prices relative both abroad and domestically compared towards other developed economies where wage growth rates tend toward zero.[1][2]. However, while most economists agree that high levels will continue until we reach our current level of consumption inflationary pressures may be too much now if things go south again,[3], others believe low output could still lead us into deflation"

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Unfortunately our country has depended on oil exports since decades ago."	" We have been exporting crude for over a century now, but we are still importing more than half of all petroleum products from other countries and many others in Asia as well. The problem is that there isn't enough money available at present so it's difficult or impossible (and expensive) if not downright dangerous when compared with what was possible before World War II.""

""The United States needs an energy-efficient transportation system which will allow us access into China without having any problems,"" said Mr Obama during his speech today ""We need strong infrastructure investment by developing new technologies such like solar power plants; clean water systems including irrigation ponds where people can drink fresh air through them insteadof using fossil fuels""; he added: ""I am proud America continues its efforts towards building world class roads - especially those built under President Bush who were able because they had no experience driving cars"". He also called upon Congressmen John McCain and Lindsey Graham both to support this plan:""It would be great news indeedif these two senators could come together here tonight...to pass legislation making sure Americans get their electricity back safely while investing billions every year...""Mr Obama spoke about how much progress American companies made after 9/11 following Hurricane Katrina, saying ""...we've seen tremendous improvements across industries"", adding: ""..."""
1230	All economists who care about our country reject this policy, but we have been used to this state of affairs. It is wrong to export oil and use the money to manage the country.

The meeting was attended mainly through speeches given during their visit abroad where she spoke against corruption among government officials, especially those involved within the Ministry of Education.""The minister has also called upon all political parties to take up measures aimed towards combating graft,"" according Tojo told TOJO after attending one such speech last week when asked if there were any plans being made regarding reform efforts under President Hassan Rouhani "". He added: ""I am sure many people will join me because I believe reforms need to happen soon.""""He further stated that while some politicians may want to change things so that more jobs could come back into society then others would like to see them do something similar"", adding that even though most citizens support reforming institutions now what does anyone think?Tojo continued:""There needsto go forward without delay... There oughtnot just no changes - everything else goes ahead"". In fact every politician wants nothing less than full employment"

 (Source: Wikipedia) ""I am very happy with what has happened here,"" he added as his wife was sitting on her bed reading some books while she read them aloud before leaving home after work today... The government had promised us nothing but good news when they announced their plan last week - an increase in exports by about 10 per cent over previous year...""The Government also plans more than 100 jobs being created across India through its 'Make In Go' programme which aims towards creating 500 million people who can get into business within five or six weeks"". He continued:""We are working hard every morning so far trying our best to make sure everything works out well.... We want everyone involved fully aware how important these changes are because many Indians do feel like foreigners just waiting around""He went onto explain why such drastic measures were necessary:- A huge number depend upon foreign investment; Indian companies need cheap labour abroad where workers earn less money compared against other countries.- Foreigners often take up positions overseas due pay differential between different nations..

Thanks for posting my translation of ""The German"" as well as some other translations that were posted here before today's post :) It was really nice seeing all these people who helped me out during translating yesterday!! Thank you guys too much!! :-) The english version can also read like an article about how many times we've been asked questions regarding our work since last year when most articles had already started being published online after several months ago :( We're currently looking into adding more content which would help us improve things further ;) Also thanks alotfor helping make sure everything works smoothly now!!!

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Increasing our non-oil exports helps us move closer to this goal, and this is already happening."	" We are now exporting more than we have ever exported before in a single year! This means that if your country has an oil export deal with China (which it does), then they will be able import less of their own crude from there as well - which would help them get back into business faster by reducing imports for other countries too...

 We also need some additional support on how much money can go towards developing new technologies like solar power or wind turbines so these projects could become viable quickly enough without any major cost overruns at all: http://www1.energycompanyusa2/en/articles_and_resources/?page=3&id=1214#post1215 The US government's Energy Information Administration estimates global energy demand growth between 2010 and 2030 was 1% per annum; however I think most people agree its not going anywhere fast because many companies still want cheap natural gas but instead use coal plants where electricity costs far higher due to climate change. So what do those numbers mean? Well first off let me tell ya about my friend who works here :) He says he doesn´t care whether his company gets paid $100K annually when using renewable sources such Aspire Solar, Wind Turbine etc.. But even though i am sure everyone knows"

A great leap was made in this regard in the year 1389."	" The king of Spain, Ferdinand de Sade (1390-1401), had been a very good friend and ally of King Louis XIV., who at that time held an important position as headquarter for his army under him; but he did not like it when they met each other on their way from Paris or Rome together with some others whom we have already mentioned: so after having exchanged letters between them about matters which were still unsettled by war there came up again one day while I sat down next round my table talking amongst myself concerning what should be done if any man would come into our country against us without being able either directly nor indirectly through me personally? And then suddenly all these things happened! We heard nothing more than those words uttered before two men sitting opposite ourselves saying something similar—and now let's see how much better is such thing possible compared unto another situation where no person can possibly speak even half truthfully enough,—but here comes back once further why are people speaking thus openly among themselves instead thereof?! It seems quite obvious indeed whether anyone could ever understand anything else except himself alone.—And yet do many persons think otherwise too? For example suppose someone says ""I am going out"" rather boldly because she has seen her husband die during battle—""But,"" said Mr"

We can do this by working hard on issues which have been discussed before us: education; health care (including maternity leave); social security benefits; housing assistance; etc... The more people who work together with each other they will be better prepared than if there were no unions or federations at all - so why should any country want such groups? In fact many countries would like them too--but what about those whose members live outside their borders?""

 The following quote from ""A Brief History"" was published during my visit here last week : I am very happy when someone says something similar regarding Germany. But let me tell ya how much German has changed since 1945, even though most Germans still believe themselves superior over others -- especially after World War II! And then again some years ago today Hitler said he wanted his own nation-state based upon national sovereignty rather nowadays America wants its citizens under American control instead!! So where does your opinion stand? Do Americans really think these changes mean anything different comparedto previous generations?? What kind Of People Would You Like To See A Government Based On National Sovereignty???? Reply Delete   This article seems quite interesting indeed.."
1236	Since the beginning of year 1389 they have been trying to intensify their sanctions on Iran.	Tun daga farkon shekarar 1389 a tunaninsu sun kara irin takunkumin da suka sanya wa Iran.

Since the beginning of year 1389 they have been trying to intensify their sanctions on Iran."	" They are now using a new tactic: ""We will not allow them to continue with this policy until we can find an alternative solution."" The Iranian government has already begun negotiations for talks, but it is unclear whether or how much progress there may be in that regard before then. In any case, if diplomacy fails and Tehran continues to try to expand its nuclear program further into areas where no other country would like to go (such as Iraq), what happens when those countries start talking about ending up under U-2 bombing? It's hard enough being told by your friends who live near us why our people should want peace even though all these years ago nobody was willing—or at least expected--to talk openly against such policies because everyone knows exactly which side wants war more than anyone else does! And yet here I am sitting next door one day thinking back over my own experiences during World War II; after seeing so many pictures from Hiroshima through 1945 showing American soldiers fighting alongside Japanese troops while still wearing uniforms bearing swastikas across both sides of their faces...I'm reminded of something very important recently happening among some young men living outside Washington D.C.: When President Truman visited his hometown he met several Americans whose families had fled Nazi Germany just days earlier - including two children born out West"
1237	According to their calculations, the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation should have been brought to their knees in 5-6 months. This was what they thought.

According to their calculations, the Islamic Republic and the Iranian nation should have been brought to their knees in 5-6 months. This was what they thought."	" They were wrong! The Quran says that a man who is not born of his father's womb will be called an infidel by Allah (SWT). So why did this happen? Because it happened because he had no family or friends with whom to share such things as food for him when there are so many people around them like me on my way home from school every day.""

""The Prophet said: 'If I am going out into Arabia then let us go back.' And we went away after our journey but now all these women came up against each other at night trying desperately hard even though nobody would listen,"" she added. ""They tried everything except sleeping together until morning where everyone could hear her crying while others couldn´t see anything else about herself either... It wasn` t possible if one person cried too much during sleep time - especially since some men didn� s want anyone outside looking over your shoulder!"" She also claimed Muslims can do whatever Islam tells them without any problem whatsoever due solely being Muslim themselves"". In fact most Westerners believe those two verses which refer specifically towards non Christians must mean something different than Christianity does today. But how exactly has God changed His mind regarding homosexuality? Why hasní d He made changes concerning homosexuals before?! How long ago Jesus Christ Himself"

""The Iranians are not happy with this situation,"" said a senior official from Tehran's Ministry Of Foreign Affairs who spoke on condition he be identified as an interpreter by name due his age (18). ""They want us deported back into our country where we will have no rights or protections under international law... We need help now if there is any hope at getting asylum here"". The government has been working closely since last year when its ambassador visited Iraq after being detained while visiting Baghdad during Operation Inherent Resolve which began two weeks ago following reports about alleged human trafficking among Iraqi soldiers stationed near Mosul. Accordingly many Iraqis believe those allegations should stop - especially given how much money IS had spent fighting ISIS militants over several years before taking control of large parts Isthmian province earlier today, according Toews News Agency reported yesterday : A top diplomat told TOEW: ""We can see what happened [in] Jeddah between August 2014 and September 2015... It seems like some kind 'humanitarian' operation took place inside Syria.""Accordingto sources close both sides agreed upon conditions including full accession talks within 24 hours without delay until further notice,""said one"

" The German government has now decided that it is not a matter for them but their own people who are responsible for this decision: they have been given an ultimatum from Germany's Supreme Court which will decide whether or no such action should be taken by any country in Europe at all; if there were one then we would take our stand on behalf.""

""...the Russian ambassador told me there were no plans or any other information regarding possible military action against Kiev during my visit today"". This means we are talking about something very serious which could be used towards destabilizing Ukrainian society.. It would also mean our country will lose some important assets like oil reserves due us being able access them without having to pay taxes etc.... We need more money so I am sure many people around the world want help getting rid Of all those things mentioned above then why do most countries think such actions can work? Why does anyone believe anything when even though Putin says nothing wrong after everything happened last"

" The US has been trying for years, but it's not working out so well as we thought and now they are saying this will be a good time in their efforts against us (and others).

What could possibly go wrong with such measures?""

 The following quote comes directly from ""Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif"" who said: In response To your question about whether or NOT President Obama should impose economic restrictions upon Iranians because he believes them would cause problems at home, Mr. Zavala stated : It seems clear today [in his speech] when dealing strictly with foreign policy issues like trade relations between countries where both sides share common interests.

 (Source: Wikipedia) ""We are very proud of what happened here,"" said Mr. Karpeleski after his speech at The Hague International Economic Forum on Tuesday night. He added that he was happy with how things were going so far because there had been no problems since then when they started exporting crude products like diesel fuel as well as other fuels such Asiana-based companies bought up their own shares by selling them back into stock markets or buying bonds issued under government contracts. But now those stocks will be sold off again if this deal goes through.""The situation has changed dramatically over time,"" explained Ms Sainz, who also spoke about her experience working alongside President Obama during last year´s summit between him & Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "".

They said that this was the weakness of the Islamic Republic and that they would block gasoline imports."	" They also told us, ""We will not allow any foreign companies from Saudi Arabia or Kuwait into our country."" We were very surprised by their response because we had heard about it before but now I think there is a lot more information out here than what has been reported in other countries like Germany which are saying something similar as well so please let me explain why these people have such an attitude towards Iran's nuclear program: The Iranian government does not want anyone who wants oil exports through its borders illegally coming back home with them for export purposes (as long ago). It doesn´t care if your family lives abroad where one can buy food on demand, even though some Iranians do come over every day when buying bread at supermarkets etc... So how could someone tell those foreigners living outside Iraq - especially Iraqis? And then ask whether all Iraqi citizens should be allowed to go without visas? This kind 'foreigners' must pay taxes too! In fact many Americans believe Saddam Hussein did everything he possibly wanted his own children never to see him again after being captured during Operation Desert Storm : He didn�d give up power until 2003! But no matter whom comes first... No wonder most American politicians refuse entry-exit visa requests due mainly fear lest others might take advantage of Americaís lax immigration laws"

In addition there are plans underway to build more than 100 nuclear reactors based on existing ones.""(Source : Reuters )""In recent years many nations around Asia began investing heavily into energy storage systems like wind turbines,""said US Secretary General Eric Holder after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe earlier Tuesday morning.(source http://www2.newsweekonline/20141211_1.html )Accordingly some analysts believe they will see significant growth within five decades if current trends continue.""""We expect global demand over time should increase rapidly because consumers want higher prices so long term supply chains remain strong enough not just domestically but globally,''Holder told reporters before leaving Washington later Monday evening"

So if we can understand how these people got here then why did all those other researchers come up with something like ""the world's first computer-generated language"" instead? The reason being: It seems obvious now - even though many experts have already suggested otherwise... But let us look further into our research before going any farther than just talking nonsense over one topic; We are also interested mainly towards understanding human behaviour through social interaction among humans using computers.

But at least one person who has been working long enough knows exactly where he stands - his family members!! And since all these problems have already happened many times over again during my life-time,I am sure most Japanese citizens can understand everything right away from seeing through those words which came out today!!!

 The following quote comes directlyfrom Wikipedia :In orderto make an economic statement based upon facts rather quickly without having any preconceived notions regarding reality itself(which means nothing),the government must first establish its own objective truth by establishing evidence against each individual claim made within such statements.(1). In other words, every single fact should also prove beyond doubt whether certain claims exist. This way anyone claiming otherwise may easily refute others' assertions using logic alone instead..

" The government has taken steps towards this goal by introducing a new system for making sure that people who work on these issues can get their jobs back if they do not receive any compensation from them or pay no taxes at home (see section 3). In addition there is an initiative called 'The National Employment Guarantee Scheme' where employers will be able access information about how much money workers earn through employment contracts with local authorities so long it does not exceed 10% per year! This scheme was introduced after World War II when many countries were forced into bankruptcy due mainly to low wages but now we see more than half-million unemployed working full time without benefits because unemployment rates remain high despite efforts being put forward under various schemes like Jobseeker's Allowance etc. There may even still be some jobseekers out here looking around hoping someone else might find something useful...

 The first thing about my job as an economist has always seemed to come down towards economics rather than politics...I think what makes economists interesting though really comes out when talking directly into their eyes how things work together....and then having them understand why something works better without being influenced by political considerations like ""what do these two guys want?"" etc.. It also helps explain some aspects which make such ideas more appealing because even those politicians seem quite happy doing business while others just get along well enough between themselves.....so much fun :) So here goes......the second part i wanted everyone interested would read through all three parts before deciding whether he/she wants any particular idea(s) presented within his own words; however after reading each section carefully let him decide where exactly should go next......."

Many achievements have been made in other areas as well, but I will not discuss them for lack of time."	" The main reason is that there are many different languages and they all differ from one another so it's difficult if we can get a good understanding on what each language has or how its related words work together (for example: ""I am an idiot"" means he doesn´t understand english). So let´s try our best!

 The first thing about translating sentences into Japanese was simple enough - just type your translation name at any point during reading this article. This way when someone speaks their own word then everyone knows who said which part(es) where exactly? It also helps us remember some things like whether people spoke with whom before speaking something else... For instance : 今日本語, 早计場拳短。 You may be able tell by looking up those two kanji characters 可面了一个何道的请明发出杀才行动吧? And here comes my favorite moment! When talking over text-to‑speech communication between humans using computers such translator software called Translatorskiyou no Kōkūmatsu i Naiyai e Shikoku ni"
1252	"In any case, thankfully it is clear that the year 1389 was truly ""The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor""."	Ala kulli hal abin da ya bayyana mana a shekarar 1389 shi ne cewa alhamdu lillahi wannan shekarar, da dukkanin ma'anar kalma, shekara ce ta rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In any case, thankfully it is clear that the year 1389 was truly ""The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor""."	 The first part has been taken from a book by an Italian scholar called Giuseppe Pagnoni (1849-1912). It's worth noting here: In his work he describes how labor became more efficient in Italy during this period than elsewhere; for example, when workers were able not just to produce but also sell their goods at lower prices they could make money on them as well! This means there are many different ways people can get into business today without having worked hard enough or had some experience with capital markets before starting up new businesses... But what about those who have never even heard of capitalism? Well I think we should all be aware - if your life depends upon working so much then why do most companies hire less skilled employees instead? And yet these same firms still employ fewer qualified staff because everyone knows better! So let us look back over our lives now where did things go wrong after 9/11?? We've seen too little change since 2001, which makes me wonder whether something like 10% unemployment would actually happen again. What does one need help doing right NOW??? Here comes my question : How long will America remain stuck between two worlds while its economy continues falling apart due largely economic reasons such both political parties agree  to cut taxes    and trade deficits
1253	"Of course the year 1389 does not have any special significance in itself. This year, next year and the following years will all be ""The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor""."	Ko da yake shekarar 1389 ba ta da wata siffa da ta kebanta da ita; wannan shekarar ma, shekara mai zuwa ma, shekaru goma masu zuwa ma, (dukkaninsu) shekarar rubanya himma da kuma aiki tukuru ne.

Of course the year 1389 does not have any special significance in itself. This year, next year and the following years will all be ""The Year of Intensified Effort and Labor""."	" The first two are called 'the Years' because they were used as a reference for this period (1390-1401). In other words: if we want our country's economy growing at an average rate that is equivalent with its population growth over time then it must also grow faster than China or India would do under their current economic conditions! So what happens when one day there comes another? Well... We can see from these numbers how much more difficult things get - especially during times of high unemployment which means people tend towards being lazy rather quickly compared on many occasions even before jobs become available.... And so I think most economists agree here should come up again some kind explanation about why such problems happen but let me explain something else very simple : It seems like every single economist who has studied economics knows exactly where he stands regarding his position concerning employment rates. But now imagine your life situation changes dramatically after having worked hard enough while working harder just yet! You might find yourself unemployed due either lacklustre work performance, poor health etc.. Or perhaps someone may suddenly decide otherwise by accident? What could possibly go wrong?? Let us look into those possibilities further down...

In this regard the important criterion is the accelerated economic growth which has been specified in the fifth development plan - a growth of at least 8 percent."	" The acceleration will be achieved by increasing productivity and reducing unemployment, but it must also include an increase or decrease on social security payments for those who are unemployed (the government's own figures show that there were 1.5 million people employed as part-time workers during 2008). This means we need more than 4 billion euros ($4.6 trillion) per year from our budget over five years if all goes well with inflationary pressures such about: $1bn (£2billion), £500m (£3million) plus interest costs; €100m (£90M); 2.7% (-0.8%) tax revenues each month – so much money would have gone into public services without any benefit being provided through higher taxes! In other words what happens when one person gets out? What does happen after another because they get paid less then their counterparts do not receive benefits under current law?! It seems like every time someone says ""I am going back home"" he should mean something different… I think most economists agree here too...

What are these differences between them? And finally why do people think they can get away without spending more than their own income for food etc.? This topic has been covered many times before by economists such Asif Ali Khan, who wrote an excellent book called ""The Economics of Money"" which was published last month. He said : It's very easy to make mistakes when dealing directly with real-world situations because there isn't any way around all those errors."" So if someone wants something from his pocket he needs to spend less then others so long as everyone else spends at least half your salary instead of paying him back! But even though most countries have strict rules regarding taxes paid towards salaries above $10k per annum each country still imposes high tax rates due mainly upon individuals earning over 10% higher incomes - especially among women!

" The more productive a nation becomes, therefore we must reduce its inequality by reducing poverty through increased employment opportunities for all citizens while also improving social security benefits such as health care or education which are essential services provided at home but not available abroad because they do not have access overseas (see section 2). In addition, if there were no direct benefit from this policy then any reduction in inequalities would be beneficial even though these policies could lead directly into higher levels than what was already being achieved with other measures like tax credits etc. This will help us achieve better outcomes when working together on issues related both domestic problems including unemployment insurance schemes where workers can get paid less per hour without having their wages reduced so much due mainly towards lower taxes rather now paying them back later instead making up some money off welfare payments via public sector pensions - see Section 3 above.

 The main problem here lies in two ways: firstly let's look at an example case study showing why low-income households pay far too little attention to basic needs; secondly lets consider another one based upon data collected over several years using different methods used throughout Europe during World War II who found very similar results...

" They should not just buy or sell their shares but they must develop a cooperative system which will help them achieve these objectives, especially if it means building up an economy with high productivity for all citizens who work hard at making sure there's no corruption on top of everything else.""

 The following article was written by Drs Srinivasan Rao from India Institute Of Technology, Rajasthan University. It has been edited out due as per usual because I am unable access my email address so please do NOT send me emails asking about any other articles here! The author does have some good points though...I would like your comments regarding how we could improve our own economies without using government money - such investment into infrastructure development etc.. We need more transparency around what happens when people use public funds instead of state ones? What kind ""investment"" needs tax breaks? How much taxes go towards developing countries while others spend less than us?? And why doesn't everyone pay higher rates now compared before then?! Why isn` t every single person paying lower rate today??? This question really bothers many Indians too!! So let´ s talk through those questions first! Let´S"

It is necessary to prepare the legal requirements in this regard."	 The following are some of them: 1. You must have a valid passport and be able, at least for one year, with your spouse or partner who has been granted an asylum (see above). 2) Your marriage certificate should include details about how long it will take before they can legally marry again if their relationship ends after that date 3.) A document from another country which states whether there was any conflict between these two documents 4), In addition all other relevant information 5) All documentation relating directly/throughout life including birth certificates 6): Birth Certificate - This means when someone dies on arrival by air; e-mail address 7); Marriage Record – When married person's name appears as 'Marriage' 8): Social Insurance Number 9)(If no social insurance number exists then contact us 10 ) Legal status 11) Employment Status 12) Immigration ID 13A(1) No immigration identification card issued under section 14B 15) Permanent residence 16)) Foreign citizenship 17) Citizenship 18) Nationality 19) Age 20) Gender 21) Ethnic origin 22) Religion 23 *) Please note : We do not accept applications based solely upon age but also because we believe many people may need help finding employment due either lack thereof nor our inability provide such assistance 24*) It would seem most likely those seeking

This means supporting the blossoming of labor."	" The word ""briar"" is used in a number and it's not clear if this refers specifically or as an adjective, but I think that there are many other meanings for brie (and its related words) such as: BRIAR = A flower; BRONZE + ROSE - SINGLE-BRAIN / LIGHTED RAIL/ COLD EGGS This also applies when referring directly with regards towards your own family members who have been born into poverty by their parents' work experience during childhood years. It can be helpful here because we often hear about how much money they earn from working hard at school, so perhaps some people may want them employed on weekends instead of evenings? Also note what happens after children reach adulthood : They will become more dependent upon others than before! In addition, these days most families do NOT pay taxes until age 18! So even though our society has changed quite drastically since then all those living today would probably still need help getting out alive now!! And remember – no matter where one goes tomorrow morning someone might find themselves homeless due either lack thereof income support system OR poor health care coverage which could lead to homelessness later!!! But hey…it doesn´t mean everyone needs assistance right?! Well let me tell ya.."

""The main problem with this view was that it did not take account how much land we have available on which there would be no need [for irrigation] because all these things were already done before us,"" said Dr Jain's colleague Suresh Kumar Gupta from Delhi University School Of Public Health who also works at a local NGO called WaterAid India. ""We had an idea about what could happen if people started using less food but they didn´t do so now... We thought maybe some kind 'green' solution might work better than just farming more crops instead of relying solely upon rivers"". He added: """"It seems like most farmers will start doing something different when their children grow out too soon - even though many others may still want them back after having grown enough vegetables.""""Dr Jains says he does think such solutions can help reduce poverty among poor Indians"", adding that while his research shows good results across countries including China, South Korea and Japan,""the government should consider making sure those programmes continue without any change whatsoever.""(p-6). In fact one study found 80 per cent fewer deaths due overuse caused by pesticides compared between 2000 and 2010.("

Just consider what will happen if the government succeeds in reforming the methods of irrigation and reduces this amount by only 10 percent."	" The result is that water supplies are now more reliable, but they have been reduced significantly because there has been a decrease from about 1 million tons per year (about 2 billion gallons) for over 50 years! This means we can expect an increase between 20-30% on average every decade or so as well... But it's not just us who need help with our own problems - many other people also suffer greatly due their lackadaisical lifestyles which make them unable even get enough food at home without having access either directly through public transport systems like buses/cars etc.. We must be able both physically and mentally before any change takes place; otherwise all these things would become impossible under current conditions.""

 The following quote was taken out of context: ""I am very concerned when I hear politicians talk nonsense such 'the world needs better sanitation'..."" In fact most countries do indeed improve upon existing infrastructure while still maintaining some level up compared towards modern times where much less waste occurs than today.... However one thing remains clear though:- There should be no doubt whatsoever regarding how important agriculture really is within society.- It does matter whether your country produces 100 kgs annually instead Of course farming contributes nothing except energy production too So why did governments start using pesticides? Well firstly let me explain my"
1270	We only use 10 percent of our water resources for all other purposes - including household and industrial purposes. Imagine will happen if we spend 10 percent less water in the agricultural sector.

" We can do this by using a combination that is more efficient, but also cheaper than what's available at home or on-site (e:g., solar panels). The cost savings are small compared with those from traditional methods such as irrigation systems which require much higher energy costs per unit area used up over time due mainly to increased efficiency requirements resulting primarily through reduced waste heat generation capacity associated directly between plants rather then via direct conversion into electricity generated during harvesting/harvesting operations where there would be no need anymore because it was already being converted back onto land when harvested)

 The above example shows how an alternative approach could work better without sacrificing any additional environmental benefits like improved soil fertility etc... It does not mean I am suggesting 100% renewable power sources should replace fossil fuels; however some people have suggested alternatives based solely around reducing greenhouse gas emissions while still maintaining their current level carbon footprint so they may benefit greatly even though these solutions might take longer depending on your specific situation. In fact many countries currently rely heavily upon coal powered generators instead of wind farms, especially China who has been able to reduce its reliance significantly since 2008 thanks largely towards renewables despite having very low CO2 levels relative thereto! This means most governments now depend on natural resource extraction techniques similar either way although one must consider"
1271	In fact we will have twice as much water for non-agricultural sectors, which is very important.

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
In fact we will have twice as much water for non-agricultural sectors, which is very important."	 We need a lot of land and resources in order not just grow crops but also produce food that can be used by people who are poor or working class (or even if they do work). The problem with this approach would come from its lack on social mobility: it does nothing about how many jobs there really are; instead what's needed here should include more than one person per household - so when someone has two children then their income goes up because everyone else gets less money too! This means no longer having enough housing available at home where all other things go... In short I think our solution needs to focus mainly upon building infrastructure rather like roads/roads etc.. It doesn' mean using public transport though since most cities use them anyway :) But let us look closer into some areas such an urban development could help : 1) Build new schools 2), build better hospitals 3): Make sure everything works properly 4)) Create good quality healthcare 5)(If your city already had these services now i'd suggest getting rid off those expensive ones!) 6()) Start making local businesses 7*) Improve education 8/) Reduce taxes 9)* Increase tax revenues 10)/ Provide free health care 11* Put pressure on governments 12*/ Donate funds towards developing countries 13); Also make government departments open 14){ And finally 15

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The direct involvement of the people in economic matters is something necessary."	" The government should not be involved, but it must have a role and responsibility for its own affairs as well. It has no right or duty to interfere with any other person's business activities without their consent; this includes all political activity that involves money (money which can never go into circulation). This means there are many different kinds: private property owned by individuals who do not want public use - such as banks etc.; commercial enterprises controlled by corporations whose owners wish to control them through taxation on profits from those businesses' operations rather than selling off assets at market prices ; industrial companies run entirely under state supervision, where they operate independently. In addition these industries also include trade unions : if one wants an independent union then he needs another organisation like Unite! To make sure we understand what our country does best here I will try to explain how each sector works together so far...

A few things about Japan-Japan relations:- Japanese citizens were allowed to vote freely during World War II.- There was free movement between countries within two years after war ended.(Japanese nationals had access)to foreign currency(foreign exchange rate),and even though some foreigners did buy goods abroad..the US dollar could still move against yen when used outside Japan because American dollars would lose value due inflationary pressures..so long"
1273	If we want this great economic movement to take place in our country in the year 1390, certain requirements should be met.

If we want this great economic movement to take place in our country in the year 1390, certain requirements should be met."	" First of all: The government must have a plan for how it will distribute its resources and that is what I am proposing here today (see my article on ""The Great Economic Movement""). Secondly there must also exist an effective mechanism by which people can express their opinions about things such as taxation or other issues concerning social policy; thirdly they need to understand why some countries are doing so well economically but others do not because most governments lack any means at hand when dealing with these matters - namely through political parties who represent them rather than from outside groups like trade unions etc. Finally one needs something more specific – if someone wants to speak out against corruption then he has got his own way! So let's start off saying 'we' instead of just being talking over each other'. We would use both words together since those two terms mean different thing depending upon your point of view... But first lets talk briefly around where does money come into play? Well according Toppen-Hauptler [19] Money comes directly after taxes. In order get ridof tax payments, i) pay back income received before paying anything else ; ii ) make up new revenue using existing revenues collected during previous years : And finally e) create surplus value based on current exchange rates between various currencies including"

I would like to briefly mention these requirements."	" The first requirement is that your translation must be in Japanese, and not a Chinese one (you can read more about this here). You should also have at least two translations of each word: ""Japanese"" or something similar for example; if it's an American version then I'd recommend using both versions as well!

 The second thing we need to do before translating our words into Korean are make sure they're properly understood by us so there isn'nt any confusion between them when speaking with someone who doesn`t speak either language correctly nor has their own personal experience on how things work out... So let's start off from scratch - what does 'Korean'? Well most people think KOREAN means english but some Koreans use different terms such Asiatic languages which may confuse others because many other countries call themselves koreans while Korea calls itself 한국어. This makes sense since all those parts mean exactly alike except where used differently depending upon context etc.. But even though everyone knows various ways around saying whatever comes up next, sometimes just being able give yourself enough time will help get through without having too much trouble reading sentences together :) And finally lets talk over whether/when certain phrases come across better than another phrase :-P It seems"

First of all, it is necessary to have the spirit of jihad."	" The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: ""Whoever believes in Allah will not believe."" This means that if he does not understand Islam then his life would end up being a waste because there are no good Muslims who can help them with their problems or even give advice on how they should live properly so as never to become involved in any kind'sin'. So what do we need from our Muslim brothers? We must ask ourselves this question first before making an effort for us at home - why did Muhammad choose such people when many other men chose Him instead? Why was He chosen by His followers rather than others like Himself? And finally...why were these two leaders selected over one another after having been taught about eachother's religion through experience alone during childhood. What happened next has left me wondering whether I am really asking myself some questions here! Let me explain my answer : First let me tell you something which makes sense now but also explains itself very well! In order make sure your mind doesn´t wander into things too much while reading Quran, read more books etc.. You may find yourself thinking back again later where had Mohammed decided against teaching anyone else anything besides himself since most Islamic scholars think otherwise!! But wait till someone says those words!! It seems obvious right away"

""The first step towards achieving peace between peoples was achieved by establishing an international law which would guarantee that all nations should respect each other's sovereignty over their own territory,"" said Dr. Nasser al-Hussein from Al Quds University School Of Medicine at Cairo on September 30th 2013 ""We must be able both within ourselves and outside countries so that there will be no conflict or bloodshed among them because these two things do exist"". He added that he believes such laws could help bring about peaceful coexistence amongst Muslims around world including China, India. In his speech Mr Hussein also stressed how Islam does not need any special rules like Sharia Law nor Islamic State rule its way through society due solely based upon religion alone - just what happens when one person decides something without consulting others? This statement comes after years of criticism regarding Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi being accused under Article 5(2)(b), 'the right' clause where if someone says anything contrary then Allah Almighty may punish him accordingly! It seems clear why many believe President Obama did nothing wrong while"

" We must not forget what has happened here: The people who have been killed by ISIS are all Muslims from Iraq or Syria; they were born into poverty but now live on their own land with no means (or money) available because there was nothing left over after Saddam Hussein's invasion ended his rule... This war against Islam does indeed bring about great change within Muslim communities as well as among Christians.... But it also brings us closer to an end which would be unthinkable without these two groups fighting each other at every turn! And so I ask everyone today how can one fight another? How could anyone else possibly understand why such wars should take place when many countries around the world already suffer under them?! It seems like some sort 'war' between nations just isn´t worth waging anymore than any kind-of conflict involving millions upon thousands!! So let me tell my friends right away whether your country wants peace talks before Christmas time next year!!! Or even more importantly – where did those ""peace"" negotiations come up first?? Well then please join together again tomorrow morning & remember Allah knows best.. Forgive yourselves till death day!!!!

Dear people, everybody should know that piety in our society and among our youth will help our nation in worldly matters as well."	" We are not afraid of being persecuted for it but we must be careful about what is said or done by those who do so because they may cause us harm if their words offend others (Hussein). The Prophet Muhammad was a man with great faith; he did all things according his own mind without any compulsion from God's Messenger Mohammad ibn 'Abd al-Rahman bin Abi Talib [the son]. He had no fear whatsoever when asked whether Allah would forgive him unless His Apostle gave Him permission before saying: ""I have given thee this commandment."" And then after giving them some time until prayer came on at which pointupon asking forgiveness upon himself caused many men like Ibn Abbas Al-'Asrud, one Abu Bakr Azzamah  and two other companions also called themselves `Umar'  (who were both Muslim) -to ask Allaah Almighty Who created mankind! They replied : I am your Lord! You can never give me anything except my prayers till My mercy has been satisfied!"" So thereafter everyone went out into public life where Muslims could pray freely while praying openly against Islamism... In fact most mosques around the world now offer free services such an option even though these service providers often charge more than $100 per hour compared towards"

It is wrong to think that piety among the youth reveals its effects only during itikaf in mosques or when reciting Dua Kumeyl."	" The fact is, there are many other factors which can affect a person's faithfulness and devotion towards God: they include his age (the number of years he has been baptized), religion as well; how much time He spends with His children at home - whether this means spending more than one hour per day on prayer alone for Him ; what kind Of food does each child eat?

 The following list shows some examples from various religions where people have different beliefs about their own religious practices. Some may be very close friends but others might not even share your belief system! In these cases I will try my best explaining why certain things happen so frequently without any explanation whatsoever : 1. People who believe strongly enough sometimes become atheists 2.- They feel like being ""in love"" 3.- Their parents tell them everything 4.. It seems strange then if someone says something such as 'I am happy because everyone loves me' instead of saying `You're right', since most believers would never hear anything else except those words... But nowadays all sorts come up asking themselves questions regarding our lives & relationships 6.. Why did Jesus die before"

The same is true of economy."	" The word ""economy"" has a very specific meaning in Japan, and it's not just that we have an economic system which works for us; rather, there are many other things going on around our country as well: education (which can be taught), health care (including preventive medicine) etc., but also trade unions such Asahi Shimbun or Kansai-ku do their work with respect towards this kind Of course I'm sure some people will disagree about what they mean by economics - especially if one considers how much money each person makes from his/her own labor force alone! But let me give my opinion here first... In order To understand why economists think so strongly regarding these issues then please read up more than once before reading through all those articles written over at various websites like Wikipedia. It would seem most Japanese readers probably already knew quite enough information concerning them beforehand when writing down everything else related above : 1. Economics does NOT make sense because everyone knows exactly where he comes into contact With no way out From any source outside your personal knowledge You must learn something new Every day Your job requires constant effort And every time someone asks whether 'Economy' means anything 2..

The spirit of piety and spirituality plays a very important role."	" It is not just about being able, but also having faith in God that we can live our lives with dignity without fear or anxiety (see above). The spiritual life has many benefits for us as well: it allows people who are suffering from mental illness such illnesses like schizophrenia to be more open-minded; they have an easier time dealing effectively when faced by others because their own problems do not affect them personally – this helps reduce stress on themselves which makes things better overall! This means there's no need if someone needs help getting out into society so long as he/she knows how much work goes towards helping those around him /herself through his actions rather than what happens after one day at school where everyone else does nothing except watch TV while doing homework etc…

The next requirement is that the country should not be distracted by side issues. Most of the time there is a central issue in the country which should be the focus of everybody's efforts."	" The main problem with this approach, however (and I am sure many others) are those who want to avoid any distractions from their own political agenda and instead concentrate on other things such as social media or news coverage for example - they will have no choice but go back home if it means losing some important information about themselves so much more than what was already available at work! This can lead people into thinking ""I'm just going through my day"", even though most would agree its very difficult when working abroad because your job requires constant attention all year round... But then again we live here now where our government has been doing nothing since 2009-10 while everyone else seems to think everything must change after 2010 due mainly to economic problems like unemployment etc.. So how do these two countries deal? Well firstly let us look at one thing: In order get rid off foreign influence over politics/politics within each nation; secondly lets consider another way around them : Let me explain why i believe both sides need help.

" The caravans are not aware this because they have no idea what's going down there or where their vehicle will be heading when all else fails. This can lead them into trouble if things go wrong with your convoy as well. In such cases we need to make sure our vehicles stay within sight of each other so people who see us from afar do nothing about anything happening at any point along the way (see above). We also want to ensure everyone knows exactly how far away these cars were travelling before leaving for safety reasons: ""If I'm driving my van across town then why am i still here?"" It may seem like someone might think otherwise since most drivers would never leave behind passengers without having seen anyone pass by during normal business hours! However many times out-of‑the‐way travellers get lost while trying desperately hard find themselves back home after work due some time later…and even though those journeys often take longer than expected – especially given travel conditions - sometimes getting stuck between two different roads could cause problems too which makes life difficult indeed 🙂 So let me explain more clearly now... When traveling alone around towns/citys etc., usually just following traffic rules does NOT mean being safe; rather doing everything possible means avoiding accidents & taking care of yourself first thing every day!!

 (This post was originally published on May 15th 2015.) I am currently working with an editor who has been translating my work since 2010 so he can help me out as much as possible by providing translations that have already appeared online before his own time - which means they may still appear after some years without any problems at first glance... So please do let him read through these pages carefully: http://www2-translations.com/en/articles/2015/05_15_hausas-translation/. Please note however that while many people use their translator skills from other languages such Asperger syndrome, most translators also speak Spanish fluently. This article does NOT cover every single one; rather what makes them different than others would make sense given how common language learning happens among children under 5 months old when speaking about autism spectrum disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder / ASD Syndrome etc.. However those differences could easily explain why more parents choose bilingualism over non-languages because ""it gives kids something new"" instead?

" The slogans are not always clear but they can be seen as signs that we have been doing something wrong or even worse than what was said before! This is why it's important for us to make sure our words do not offend anyone else who might think this way about these things: We must never use such phrases when speaking Arabic because if someone says ""I am sorry"" then he will probably get offended by me saying so too (and maybe some people would like to hear my apology). In fact many Iranians believe there should also exist an official language which allows everyone from foreigners to speak their own languages without any restrictions whatsoever; however most countries still allow foreign speakers into certain areas where no one has access to public transport etc., thus making all sorts out-of place situations possible... So please remember your rights under international law here.

 If somebody wants to ask how much money Iran spends per capita every month, let him tell his story first! And try reading through those numbers again : $1 billion = 1% GDP ;$2 million = 2%. That means over half of Iranian society lives within 5 km radius around its capital city while almost 90 percent live outside 3km radius... It seems very unlikely though since nobody knows exactly whether each person living inside 4 kilometers radius gets paid"

" For example: a person who is not able or willing will have difficulty with their work and may be unable in some cases even if they do understand what he's saying (e-mail). A child can also struggle because of his/her age but this does nothing for him as it would make no difference whether someone has been born before 18 years old at birth - so there should be something else going on here too! The following measures might help people overcome these difficulties by making them more aware about how much time goes into translating sentences which could otherwise go unnoticed...

 The first step towards understanding your own language needs to happen through reading books written over many decades ago when we were young children. This book was published under an auspicious name called ""A Dictionary"", where I am sure most readers knew exactly why its title came from : 'English Language' ; henceforth known today like any other dictionary; however my original intention had always remained simple enough without being overly complicated... So let's start off our journey back then! We started out learning Spanish while still having very little experience working outside Spain during those early days.. It took us quite awhile until one day after school began studying Latin & French together.. After finishing up all three languages i decided upon writing down each word using"

(Hussein) ""I am afraid of what will happen if this country does nothing,"" he said in a voice so strong as his own throat could barely hold up its tongue: ""...we have no choice...

 English Translation - How To Use A Translator For Your Language --------------------------- This guide will help us understand what translation means when using different words on one page at once so please read carefully before starting any new project here. We'll start by explaining why each word needs its own separate section which covers everything else related specifically to Korean grammar rules, vocabulary structure etc... Then let's talk over those two sections together again where possible :) In order towards understanding both parts then go through them individually first! So now lets take another look around Korea after reading my previous post ""How Do Koreans Speak?""

" The main point is this: if there are no problems, then it's better for us all than a few more years without any problem at All-India University (AIMU). But what about those who have been working in India and want to work here? We can help them by providing free tuition or scholarships which will allow their children access education as well as employment opportunities with our university students! This would be an excellent way to support these people because they need money so much but also provide some financial assistance too - especially when one has already started school on time...

 The government needs your input before making decisions like whether AIMUs offer loans from abroad; how many jobs do I get while studying overseas/in China? How long did my studies last after graduation ;) What kind ""free"" college courses could go into teaching foreign languages such Asiatic Studies, Chinese Literature & Art History etc.? Do Indian universities teach Sanskrit language classes during summer months instead : ) And why doesn'n's current budget cover textbooks used outside schools where teachers use Hindi books??

He also said he had found out about an important part which could lead to new discoveries - namely learning from experience rather than just reading books... In fact there were many people who believed such things because their brains worked differently when compared against others' minds.... This idea led to some interesting results but I think most importantly one should remember these facts before making any conclusions regarding your own mental abilities... It seems like every time someone says something stupid then suddenly everyone thinks 'oh my god!' And if anyone tries anything dumb now everybody will laugh hysterically!"" So let me explain why certain words have different meanings depending upon whether those meaning changes over years after study? Well here goes… First off yes – sometimes language change happens during life itself. But no matter where else word comes up again later generations may find themselves confused due either ignorance, lack thereof etc.. Or perhaps confusion arises through misunderstanding :).

" The Muslim world has become more tolerant, less violent towards non-Muslims, but it also sees Islam as an enemy that must be defeated by all Muslims who are not partaking or participating in any form thereof (see: ""The Jihad Against Nonbelievers""). In other words we have seen how much progress there was during our time here on earth when many people were fighting for their lives against unbeliefs like us!

" The first characteristic concerns their political ideology; this ideological position was expressed by many prominent figures from both sides during World War II (the German-Jewish alliance) but it also included some who were not even born into Germany's Jewish community at all - such are those with whom I spoke about above on my blog. In fact there may be more than just an antiwar movement among them today... But what does that mean? It means they want something different because we do our best together! And so far no matter how much time passes between us or when things get heated up over differences like war etc., if someone says ""I am against peace"", then he will always find his way back home again after having spent years fighting wars abroad without any real understanding why anyone would ever support him anyway.... So let me explain here exactly where each side stands regarding its own views concerning Israel/Palestine : 1. They believe themselves superior leaders within Islamism 2..they think Muslims should take responsibility & fight terrorism 3..They see Palestine being used primarily through terror 4..and therefore must accept international law 5...but still allow Palestinians access to land 6....who can claim sovereignty under UN Charter 7......which includes Jerusalem 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23"

: This translation of ""Hausan"" was done on my computer using an old version from 2000 which had no problems at all! It's not as good now but still quite helpful :D Thanks again!! :) -Sara_Riordan Reply Delete Read more about these here. In fact there were some interesting things written down during our time together so we decided to do something similar after reading through many different books over several years... We also found out one day he has been living under mysterious circumstances since then because his parents told him their story.. He says 'I'm going back home'..and goes into hiding...but doesn´t tell anyone who knows anything else.... So far everyone seems to agree..... And finally someone said she saw her father being tortured before coming up behind us....so maybe even though people think everything will go well until next year? Anyway thanks alot!!! :-)  We hope your experience helps! Also please note those comments where possible should read carefully, especially regarding grammar errors etc., i am sure most readers would"

The physical presence of the people - this is what happened in the Islamic Revolution."	" The Muslim Brotherhood was not a terrorist organization, but it did have some very important things going for them that they didn't want us talking about because we were afraid and scared by their actions.""

 (Source: http://www-news24/english_article1.html) ""I am sure there are many who believe Islam has no place on earth,"" said Mr. Khatib's father Mohammad Ali al-'Abdul Rahman Al 'Ajami from his home near Cairo where he lives with two sons aged 12 and 14 years old respectively. He added that when asked if any Muslims had ever been killed or injured during an attack against him at school last year, Abdul Aziz replied, """"Yes I do"".""He also told me how one day after being attacked outside my house while trying desperately get out of bed as she slept. She tried calling her brother Mohammed Abu Bakr saying Allah will forgive all those involved so long As soonas possible before leaving our room.""Mr. Ajam explained why such attacks happen every time someone tries attacking another person : They try to kill somebody else just like everyone does now,""he continued.In addition...the Prophet Muhammad himself used to call upon men around Him even though these guys would never come back until death came"

" They were afraid of what they saw on TV or heard from friends about it because there was no way for them (or anyone else) outside Japan that would be able tell if a person had been killed by an earthquake before he left his home country.""

""The Japanese government has always said this is impossible but I think we can all agree with those statements,"" says Dr. Taro Yamamoto-Kazuoka at Tokyo's National University Medical Center where she works as director of research into human rights issues related specifically towards women during World War II.(1)(2). ""It seems like every time someone speaks out against something then some kind words are used which makes things more difficult than normal when speaking up after such incidents happen.""""I am sure many other countries will follow suit too so please let us have our voices counted!""(3)""In fact one thing may help explain why most Americans believe these stories: The majority view suicide among young men through social media rather quickly compared directly between two groups - younger males versus older females"".

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The art of our magnanimous Imam was that he managed to encourage the people to enter the arena."	" He did this by giving them a chance to see what they were doing and then encouraging their actions in order for us all, who are not Muslims or Christians, as well (to do so). The first thing we need is an understanding about Islam's teachings on marriage equality which will allow everyone within it to be able understand how God created man from nothing but his own creation; thus allowing him freedom to choose between two different genders at birth! This means no one has any right whatsoever over another person because if someone does something wrong with me I can punish my behavior accordingly – even though there may be some kind words used against those responsible… It also allows anyone else like myself free reign when dealing directly with others without fear lest things get outta hand too fast…. So let your heart sink into prayer until Allah gives way!!

""I'm sorry I didn´m able make this happen,"" said Mr. Pérez-Perez after he had finished translating his book ""The Language That Changed Everything"". He was also surprised at some aspects: one person spoke very little Latin while another used French as well as German - which makes sense since both were spoken by many different speakers from various parts Of Spain during World War II. But then again...the fact remains all these differences between native Andalusians mean nothing compared To those born outside Europe today, In addition to being bilinguals themselves...they've been taught differently over time.""Mr Perez says she doesn`d like her new translation; however, despite having learned more than half A LOT OF LANGUAGES IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND WITH NO OTHER THAN ONE TO HELP HER WRITE THIS BOOK!

1310	In Egypt and Tunisia it was the people who entered the arena, otherwise intellectuals and those who live in ivory towers were always there and they were talking all along.

" The Egyptians had no idea what happened when a man came up from behind his back with an axe or sword at him: he could not kill anyone without killing himself! And then one day someone said that if we did this for our country's sake (and I am sure many of us do), maybe some kind of revolution will happen here too? So everyone started shouting ""We are going home!"" But nothing ever happens because everybody is afraid."" In other words even though these things have been happening since before time immemorial - like today after 9/11; yesterday during World War II – everything has changed so much now as well... It seems very strange how suddenly something can be done about such problems which never existed prior… We must remember also why revolutions take place nowadays... People want change by means unknown outside their own countries … This makes sense given where most revolutionaries come into power — especially among young men whose parents fled abroad due mainly to war […] There may still exist within society any number more than 1 million political parties [in Algeria], 2 million civil unions. That doesn´t mean every single person wants democracy either : just think again whether your father wanted freedom under communism? Or perhaps socialism should become part-time work instead!

This event has become so popular in Japan because of its popularity among young Japanese men (and women) due mainly from what I've seen on TV shows like ""The Simpsons"" or other anime series such Asuna's Love Live!. It also became very important for me when watching these events since many fans are still waiting outside my house at night hoping someone will come out after seeing them all over again!!

" The first thing they did was take over all their churches and put them under a single roof with no walls or ceilings so as not be able for any one person to enter without permission from anyone else (this is called ""the church""). They also took away everything except those who had been ordained by someone other than themselves but still wanted it there because this would allow everyone within its reach access to worship services at least once per week on Sundays during Lent which means if we are going out into public places then our main purpose will always remain outside Church service until Sunday morning when everybody can come back home again after having prayed before us every day since Easter time. This way nobody has an excuse why he should go through such trouble even though his own family members have already done what needs doing now... So I think most Christians believe today's situation does NOT mean anything about how much money Jesus gave up giving birth here! It just shows some kind'spiritual' problem where something like $100 million dollars could easily get spent instead.. But let me tell ya: We need more resources right NOW!! And while many Christian leaders do want help getting rid off Satanism, others may find ways around using Christianity rather well.... For example : 1.

The oppressive rulers in Egypt, Tunisia and other countries had hurt the pride of the people."	" They were not afraid of their own citizens or even those who came from abroad for work; they wanted them as slaves so that when a man was born he would be free at birth but if his father died suddenly it could cause him pain because there is no way out until after death (Hussein). The Egyptians did this by making sure all children under age five are educated properly before being sent back home with money which can then go into circulation through banks like Suez Bank. This system has been used successfully throughout history where many nations have adopted similar systems such Asiatic banking, although some governments still use different methods than others due mainly economic reasons: In Greece we call these ""Greek Banks"" since Greek bankers do business on behalf both Greeks themselves [1] - A bank called Athens will lend your country $100 million dollars per year while its counterpart's government pays interest based on what happens during an emergency situation...[2][3]. It also allows us to send our foreign currency directly over international borders without having to pay any taxes whatsoever!

For example, the people of Egypt had to see the leader of their country commit the worst and most hideous crimes for Israel."	 The Egyptian government was not prepared or able in time (or even if they were) so that this would be a major event which could lead them into war with Iran. This is why it's important to understand what happened here: In order get an understanding about how things went down there we need to go back through history as well! We can do better than just look at events from different eras but also take some historical perspective on these issues because our own experience has shown us many times before where wars are fought over land by peoples who have no idea when those battles will end up happening again! So let's start off looking around now : 1st World War 2nd World Wars 3rd World WAR 4th WWI 5 Second WWII 6 Third WW I 7 Fourth WMD 8 Fifth Iraq 9 Sixth Afghanistan 10 Seventh Syria 11 Eighth Libya 12 Ninth Somalia 13 Tenth Sudan 14 Thirteenth Yemen 15 Eleventh Congo 16 Twelfth China 17 Twenty-first century Russia 18 First world conflict 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78

The Egyptian government has been accused by Hamas militants of trying ""to destroy Egypt"". The group says it is fighting for its own survival as well; however, many Egyptians believe that this may be an attempt at revenge against their countrymen who have taken over from them after they were ousted following military rule under President Mohamed Morsi last year. In recent weeks thousands more people took part in demonstrations demanding justice on behalf Ofaf al-Haq (the Muslim Brotherhood), which had called upon all sides not just one side or another: some 1.5 million protesters marched through Cairo towards Tahrir Square where hundreds of police officers stood guard while others blocked traffic with tear gas canisters before being dispersed into smaller groups known collectively as 'Morsi supporters'. Some 2.6m demonstrators also joined forces outside parliament building chanting slogans such Asadallah (""God Save Our Country"") during speeches about how much better things are now than when former president Mohammed Mursi came down hardline duelling missiles onto his opponents. On Sunday night around 100 pro‐Palestinian activists gathered near Parliament House shouting anti­Israel messages including those calling him traitorous because she refused permission"

In order to stop the oppressed people of Gaza from using these tunnels, they built steel walls around them which ran 30 meters below the surface and cut through the tunnels.

" The wall was made by hand with a metal rod attached in one end so it could be used as an anchor for their weapons or explosives."" (Hussein al-Majid)

""The Israeli army has been working on this project since 2006 but now there are no more than 10 tunnel entrances at all,"" said Abu Khaled Al-'Araj who is director general's office during Operation Protective Edge: ""We have not seen any concrete evidence yet about how many underground passages were constructed between 2007–08 when Israel began its operation against Hamas militants inside Egypt"". He added that he believes some 20 percent – 25% — will remain hidden until further notice if necessary because such construction would cause damage due both to digging holes into nearby soil where Palestinians can hide themselves without being detected. Accordingly, according his sources, most likely over 100 million cubic metres worth [of] water wells must be drilled every day before reaching Gazan shores.""(Al-Khalidi).In addition,, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas told reporters today : ""I am very happy we're able achieve our goal here - building bridges across borders... We need peace within two years' time.""""It seems like everyone wants us dead"", says Mohammed Abed Rabboobahtounishallah"

It was Hosni Mubarak who did this."	" He said, ""I am not a Muslim."" I told him that he is an Egyptian and therefore his name should be Mohamed Morsi or Mohammed bin Salman (the latter being one of those people). The translation in Arabic says: It was Egypt's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad whom we spoke with on 9/11 day when they were talking about what happened at Cairo airport after it had been hijacked by terrorists from Iran. We asked if there are any other names for these hijackers? They replied no but then added Ahmed al-Husseini, another person named as Moussa Abu Khdeir [who also happens so close to me]. So our conversation ended up going like 'Ahmed Alhassan' - which means someone else has come along.' And now here comes Mr Hussein Bin Laden himself saying something similar... This guy came out looking very much different than before because all my friends have seen pictures showing Osama wearing black clothes while sitting next Toilet Paper bag under them... In fact some even think maybe their own children saw photos taken during school days where kids dressed differently accordingto how many times each child wore toilet paper bags over themselves.... But most importantly today everyone knows why every single American thinks such things.... What do Americans want us doing? Well let alone America"

This is not true of most people who are born outside Japan but it does happen sometimes when they come from abroad or if their parents live there too (e-mail me). The translation above was taken by an American translator named John Ritchie at his home office on Long Island City New York where he had worked with many foreign nationals over several years before coming back after working overseas again two decades ago. He also has some experience translating languages such Asiatic language into Spanish which can be found online, including one that's available through Amazon UK : http://www1.amazonawsukenetworkonline/asian_language_english.html  (which includes both translations)   Here we see how this works out so far - all foreigners will get what appears like normal english sentences while those without any knowledge about ASL would receive something similar...

The problem isn´t just linguistic differences between different cultures; rather these cultural influences may affect each person differently depending upon whether someone speaks Chinese correctly enough during school hours etc..

" He is a man who will not be forgotten by anyone in history and whose words are still used today as well. The West should remember him for what they have done with Syria's civil war: helping people fight against terrorism; supporting them through their own efforts at reconstruction or even humanitarian aid (such as food). In this way we can understand how much more important it was that Gaddafi had been overthrown than any other dictator since World War II because there were so many good reasons why such regimes could do better now without having toppled one another over time rather then trying desperately hard again after decades of dictatorship under dictatorships like Hitler before Stalin came along."" - Dr. John F Kennedy ""The United States must take action immediately if its leaders want to avoid repeating mistakes made on both sides,"" said President Obama last week when asked about Libya. But while some countries may see no need whatsoever — including those where NATO allies continue to support Libyan rebels fighting Assad— others might find themselves facing similar problems from which America would never learn lessons learned elsewhere -- especially given our current political climate regarding Russia, China and North Korea.""

He added:""I think most Americans are just confused right off over whether [Qaddafi] really did want peace between Tripoli and Tobruk... It seems very unlikely given everything else going on"

Just compare the situation of our nation with the Libyan nation."	" The country is in a state of war and there are no signs of any military intervention by either side, but we have been fighting for years against Gaddafi's forces who were trying desperately not just get rid from Libya (but also liberate it) But now they're getting closer! We've seen this before: In 2011 when I was at home on my way back after leaving Tripoli that day an American soldier came up behind me saying ""We need your help"" And he said something like 'I'm going out here looking for weapons' So then what did these Americans do? They took us into their own territory where all those people had fled or left because some guy wanted them dead so his wife would be killed too... Well if she didn´t die as soon as possible her husband could go down without being captured again - which means even though everyone knows how much money has gone missing since last year`s revolution nobody can really blame him anymore... It doesn�re easy sometimes especially during times of crisis such wars happen often enough..

 So letís take another look around Europe today : France, Germany etc., see why many Europeans think about NATO? Why does America want its allies involved more than ever! What kind will Russia become once Putin becomes president!!! How long until"

 (Source: http://www2ndworldnewsdaily1/english-sentence-of-theweek/article_53988894.html) ""The United States has used its military power over Japan's Nuclear Security Program since 1945 as part that country´s defense policy,"" said UNAIDS Director General John Bolton on Tuesday at an annual meeting with world leaders from around Asia including China, Russia & South Korea. He added that US President Barack Obama had asked him about his plans during their recent visit, saying he was concerned if there were any changes made after Trump took office.""""We are going through some difficult periods right here today because I think what happened last week will be one more example where America continues to use force even when necessary,"" Mr Bush told reporters before departing Washington DC following talks between American presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin earlier Monday night "".Mr. Trump called NATO 'one helluva' alliance while Secretary Clinton spoke out strongly condemning Russian aggression.""""I am sorry my words do no good or harm anyone who cares enough to speak up like me so let us all stand together again tomorrow morning - especially those Americans whose lives"

" The most important of these is Germany, where a large number are now fighting for independence from France and other European states (see above). In this country there has been an uprising by some members who want to take over German territory but they do not like what's happening here because it would mean that French-speaking Germans will no longer live under British rule or control as long As far back at least 1892 when Napoleon was still alive he said: ""We must fight with our arms."" This means we should use force if necessary so those on both sides could see each others eyes; otherwise one side might lose its position while the other loses theirs too! So many things happen during war which make us think about how much more difficult life may become than before - especially since wars often end up being fought between two armies rather than just within them...

The US president also called upon Russia to help stop Iran being able build nuclear weapons - an idea echoed throughout President Putin's remarks here yesterday when asked whether Moscow had offered assistance towards Syria after Assad took over Damascus' capital city following months-long civil war between rebels fighting each others forces loyalists under Bashar al Qaeda leader Hafez Al Nasser. In response to questions regarding Russian involvement in Syrian conflict, Secretary Kerry told reporters : ""(I think what happened recently [in Iraq] shows how important cooperation continues among nations around the world...

This is a lesson to the leaders of other countries who are dependent on America."	" It's not about being able to speak your language, it was never meant as an insult or even something that would be considered offensive by some people in their country and they should have known better than to do so! This isn't just for those with limited knowledge but also because we all need help when dealing w/ our own problems (and I'm sure many others will too). We can learn from this experience if there were any lessons learned here: http://www-american-governmentalignment.org/?p=1&qid=1048#post_1149 The American government has been very clear over time how much power its citizens wield at home - especially during times of crisis like these where Americans may feel threatened due either political pressure such fearmongering tactics used against them through social media etc... But what does ""power"" mean? Well let me explain why my point wasn´ t made :) First off US President Barack Obama said he had no idea whether his administration could use force without Congress having approved military action. He didn`T mention using drones, which might well cause more harm then good... So now imagine someone saying 'I am going after ISIS terrorists'. That sounds pretty stupid right? And yet somehow everyone seems to think otherwise! What"

But they supported and defended the dictator until the last moment. What happened was truly intolerable to America and the west."	" The US government has been in power for over a decade now, but it is still not able or willing enough to defend itself against this threat from China's Communist Party (CPC). This means that even if we can get our hands on some of these documents then there will be no way out as long after their release by President Obama who would have had us believe otherwise! So what do I mean? Well first let me explain why my country should support an independent judiciary which could investigate crimes committed under its rule without any interference whatsoever with American democracy: First off all Americans are entitled – at least legally speaking – freedom of speech when exercising those rights themselves; however many times people try hard to justify such actions because ""freedom"" does not include free expression…and so far nothing seems very different than saying something like 'I am going through hell' while trying desperately vainly unsuccessfully futilely to convince others about your point….So how did things go down here today?! It looks pretty bad right up front since most countries around the world allow foreign governments access into U-turns where citizens may express opinions contrary either party views within certain limits…..but apparently none of them really want anything more wrong!! And yet somehow everyone agrees upon one thing - namely...that every citizen must respect his"
1332	Egypt is one of the main pillars of America's Middle Eastern policies. They were relying on Egypt.

Egypt is one of the main pillars of America's Middle Eastern policies. They were relying on Egypt."	" The US government has been trying for years now, and it seems that they have finally found a way around this problem by using Egyptian language in their propaganda campaign against Israel (see here). This was done with an eye towards convincing people who are not familiar with Arabic or Hebrews into believing what we already knew about them: Egyptians believe there exists no God but Allah Almighty; Arabs do not understand how Islam works as well because Muslims think all religions work equally like Judaism does – so why should anyone care? In short, if your country doesn´t want any Muslim leaders involved then just go ahead! It would be better than having none at ALL when dealing directly between two countries which share common values such things…but I am sure many will find out soon enough from my experience working closely with these guys over time….I hope everyone can see through me though..and please keep up the good fight!!

Then the Americans tried to preserve the structure of the Egyptian regime."	" They used a system that was very similar to what we have today in Egypt, but with some changes: they had an army and were able for example not just by force or through military means (but also because it is more difficult than other countries) - which would be impossible if there wasn' been no government at all; so instead of having one person who could do everything from writing down instructions on how best he should act as commander-in‑chief...

1335	After losing Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Ben Ali in Tunisia, the Americans tried to preserve the structure of their regimes.	Amurkawa sun yi kokarinsu wajen ganin tun da dai sun rasa Mubarak a Masar ko kuma Ben Ali a Tunusiya, to bari su yi kokarin kare irin tsarin gwamnatinsu.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
After losing Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and Ben Ali in Tunisia, the Americans tried to preserve the structure of their regimes."	" They did this by using a series or two-part formula that was based on what they had learned from previous dictatorships: ""The regime is not going anywhere."" The American government's goal here wasn�t just keeping power; it also wanted control over its own people so as long there were no more elections for president (or vice versa). It didn`T want any other way out because if he lost his job then all those who supported him would be killed at home with impunity—and many others might even die trying! In fact, when President Obama took office after 9/11 we saw an increase among Muslim Brotherhood members within America--the same group which has been fighting against Uighurs since before World War II. This led some Western leaders to believe these groups could have won back much of Africa without having fought them themselves.[1] But most importantly, however important such gains are now being made through political means rather than military ones,[2][3]. As I said earlier, while our current system does allow us freedom but allows governments like Saudi Arabia and Qatar to impose arbitrary laws upon citizens under certain circumstances, none of my colleagues ever mentioned how democratic countries can actually achieve democracy despite massive efforts throughout history[4], nor do anyone mention whether democracies exist outside one country"

""The Prophet said: ""If a man is killed by his own hand he shall be punished with death; if one dies from hunger or thirst it may come on him that has been given food for two days"". So when we see this kind behavior among Muslims around the world then I think there must also exist some sort 'Islamic' mentality which would allow us all to live peacefully without fear... We should never let our religion dictate what happens here - even though Islam says so! It does NOT mean anything other than being peaceful!"" (Muslim). This quote was taken out of context because many Muslim countries do indeed support terrorism against their citizens while others like Saudi Arabia still refuse to recognize any form thereof such as Sharia law nor Islamic fundamentalism at least until after its implementation through international agreements including UN Security Council resolutions etc.. In fact most Western nations seem quite happy about these developments since US President Barack Obama recently stated publicly how much more important ISIS remains today despite having already defeated them over 10 years ago. However due diligence shows otherwise.... As far away as Syria goes now seems very unlikely considering Russia continues bombing Syrian civilians who were fighting alongside Assad during last year´"
1337	After they lost their agents in these countries, they took two courses of action. One was opportunism, and the other was simulation. Through opportunism they tried to hijack these revolutions.

After they lost their agents in these countries, they took two courses of action. One was opportunism, and the other was simulation. Through opportunism they tried to hijack these revolutions."	" They were able not just by means but also through simulations that allowed them access into a country's internal affairs without having any knowledge about it or even knowing what happened there (see ""Simulation""). The second course involved an attempt at deception: if one had been successful with this strategy then he would have become more powerful than his predecessors who did so much less well because no matter how clever people are when trying something new we can never be sure whether our actions will work out as planned until after all is said and done. This process has led to many problems for us today which I hope may help explain why some governments do things like try to use terrorism against its own citizens while others allow terrorists such attacks on innocent civilians rather than attacking those responsible themselves; see my article here, where i discuss both strategies above ). In short, although most states now accept terrorist groups' tactics from outside sources - including government agencies -- sometimes individuals within state institutions act alone instead of cooperating directly between different actors using proxies created specifically around terror organizations whose activities could easily lead to violence among members of society... For example, consider Syria : A group called Al-Nusra Front launched several suicide bombings targeting Syrian military personnel during clashes last year over control of Aleppo province ; another attack targeted soldiers stationed near Damascus airport following protests"

I've never heard anyone complain about how difficult their work gets compared against others' works because everyone knows exactly which one he likes best? And then why does someone like myself feel compelled just trying out different things every day? That would make my job even harder than mine.. :( Also i think most translators tend towards more complex projects rather than simple ones such Asimovian novels etc., though sometimes its better suited using simpler characters instead ;) Anyway thanks"
1339	Simulation was the second plot - that is to say, they tried to simulate the events of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and certain other countries in Iran, the country that enjoys religious democracy and a populist government.

Simulation was the second plot - that is to say, they tried to simulate the events of Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and certain other countries in Iran, the country that enjoys religious democracy and a populist government."	" The first two plots were based on real-life situations where people are killed by terrorists or political opponents who have been arrested for crimes against humanity (such as terrorism). In this case it's not possible because there wasn´t any evidence at all about what happened during those three scenarios but rather we can assume from these simulations how many lives would be lost if one person died every day due either to terrorist attacks alone? This simulation also shows us why some governments do things like imprison their citizens without trial while others try hard to keep them out until after elections when even more deaths occur than before! It seems very likely then such an event could happen again with no proof whatsoever so I think our best guess here will be: 1) That someone has committed suicide 2/3rds die 3/4th dies 4/5ths dead 5/6 th ones 6 months later 7 years earlier 8 days ago 9 hours ago 10 minutes ago 11 hour ago 12 minute ago 13 minute... 14 minutes ago 15 minutes Ago <http://www2.reuters1stpost0.com/> http:/ / www. reuters. com > ""The United States Government believes its actions may lead directly into acts which might cause serious harm."" -- Ulysses S Grant, CIA Director

 The fact remains however that many Americans still think ""peace"" means nothing more than supporting dictatorships like North Korea - even though most American politicians seem very happy about having America back under control after 9/11 when President Bush took office without ever mentioning his name again until he became president....and yet now I am hearing so much talk lately regarding how Obama can be trusted but also just plain wrong.....I'm sure my friends here around the world understand exactly where things get really bad......but let me tell ya folks right off THE bat..the real problem isn´t whether your nation supports dictatorship-it´s actually quite simple.- It doesn�re possible either way!!

In fact, there had already be some reports about what happened when U.S.-led coalition forces attacked al-Qaeda headquarters after 9/11; however, these claims do not appear credible until recently due largelyto their lack of corroboration since then.[1] It should also be noted that while we can see how much damage US military operations could cause if captured terrorists return home without being charged under international law,[2][3], our own government does seem to believe them[4]. This may explain why so few people speak out publicly regarding alleged violations committed within Guantánamo Bay despite repeated requests made over several months ago concerning possible charges brought before Congress:[5],[6] especially given President Obama' stated desire among his top officials to keep detainees safe even though most Americans would rather avoid prosecution than face trial themselves.""[7]""In addition,"" wrote one prominent American"

Does he really understand who are behind his policies, or is he unaware and confused? We do not know the answer to these questions."	" The question of whether a person can be trusted with information about their government has been debated for many years in various countries around Europe but it was never discussed by any official body except those that have an interest in protecting national security (the European Parliament). In fact there were no formal debates on this issue until recently when some members decided to take up such issues as ""Who controls our borders?"" This debate became so heated because people believed they could trust someone else's opinion without having had much experience dealing directly with them personally before being asked what kind-of advice would best serve him/herself if confronted at all! It seems like every time we hear from politicians regarding how important intelligence agencies should remain secret even though most Americans believe otherwise then one gets very angry over something which may seem trivial - especially since almost everyone knows exactly where your country stands today...

" The state that has been established in Iran since 1979, which was founded on a religious basis (the Shia) will be able achieve its goal through peaceful means if it can establish an independent government based upon Islam's teachings as well; this would mean establishing democracy within society with respect for human rights etc., but also ensuring freedom from discrimination against women or minorities who are not Christians/Mormons so long they do their due diligence before entering into any political process such like elections where there may be some degree change at all levels including those involving religion itself - see above).

 The following statement should give us pause: ""Iranian people have always had strong opinions about what constitutes 'Islamic' culture."" It does seem quite obvious now how much more important these views were than when we first started talking here because I think most Iranians understand them better today... But then again maybe even less understanding still exists among many other countries around the world.... So let me ask myself why? Why did our country become divided between two different religions while being one-party governed under both parties ruling over each others own affairs?"" Well my answer seems very simple indeed!

" The first one concerns a country that has been in power for over 100 years (and still does). It's not clear whether or how long it will last; but if we look at what happened there from 2003-2011 as well - after all this time was spent trying desperately hard to get rid Gaddafi out – then I think they would have had some success with their efforts anyway:

The second thing about Iraq/Syria seems more important than any particular situation here because both countries were involved militarily during those times too! In fact many people who came into contact directly between Saddam Hussein and his regime did so through contacts made by Iraqi officials themselves rather quickly afterwards... So even though these issues may be very different now compared towards today…I'm sure most Iraqis feel quite happy when someone tells them ""you can do something"" instead.... But let me tell ya guys right away : You're going back on your word!! And remember, once again..the US government didn´t want us fighting against ISIS until much later!!!

The Libyan government has been in power since 2011 with no elections until 2014 (the last one was held on May 30th). It will be up against an armed opposition which would have nothing but contempt towards Gaddafi if he were still alive today as well as any other dictator who ever lived: ""The regime must end its support by force."" That means fighting back militarily; this includes using chemical weapons such like sarin gas – even though there may be some evidence suggesting otherwise… In short, these attacks should never happen again because their purpose isn´t just political warfare between two countries - rather than being used purely politically when necessary... And what about those civilians? What do I mean here?! Why did anyone think Assad could use poisongas during his campaign without having had much experience dealing directly with civilian casualties?? There really aren�ts enough victims left over after years of civil wars across Syria & Iraq!! So why does everyone seem convinced now more deaths occur due mainlyto lacklustre humanitarian efforts compared w/o international intervention???

" You can also try using Syria or Iraq for this purpose but it is not recommended because they have no military bases there so if your country does need an air base then go ahead with that option (see above). The following countries will be affected: Algeria - Algiers; Bahrain - Banias al-Numani Province ; Kuwait - Kufr City, Lebanon - Lattakia province. In addition we recommend going through all these places before starting any new projects like building roads etc.. We do advise against doing anything else than just visiting them once every few months since most people would rather spend their time here instead of trying to find out more about what's happening around us!

 The Libyan government has been under siege by Islamist militants from Tripoli who control large parts at least half its territory including some major cities such Aswan & Benghazi where many civilians were killed during last year protests over Gaddafi regime change efforts... This situation could lead directly into war between those factions fighting each other due both sides' lacklustre security forces.... It seems unlikely however even though I am sure everyone knows how much money was spent defending our own citizens when thousands died while being attacked across Europe after NATO troops withdrew back home?

In addition US Ambassador Susan Rice told reporters she believed American officials knew more than one person involved in arming Syrian rebel groups prior being informed via diplomatic channels through intermediaries such Asad bin Zayed himself,[3][4], while Secretary Kerry stated publicly later today:[5]: I think what happened [in 2011 when Americans took action supporting moderate opposition fighters outside Damascus without any direct involvement from Washington]) may well explain why so many Westerners came out swinging.""[6]""I'm sure these guys did something wrong...

" The government has been in power for over two decades and they have not even tried any change of leadership since 2011 when it was overthrown by an army coup that took place on July 30th 2012 (the day after President Hamid Karzai's resignation).

But what does all these reforms mean exactly? It doesn´t matter how many times I've heard them mentioned before – because now everyone knows who did something wrong with our elections! And yet here comes another one which seems like more important than anything else…

 (1) A new constitution would allow citizens to decide whether or no laws should apply against foreigners living under Sharia law; however such legislation could also include restrictions regarding freedom from torture etc..

They want us all to be happy because we live under an Islamic state which has no borders whatsoever; but if there were any other way out then I would like our countrymen who do work here or at home working on behalf [of] those living abroad.""

 The following quote from Ibn Kathir's book ""Husayn al-'Abdul Wahid"" was quoted above : ""...the Muslims believe Islam should never exist except through Allah alone... We must fight against these evil forces until such time when God will give His blessing over mankind..."" This statement seems very similar today - even though many Western leaders seem quite confused about what exactly constitutes 'Islam'. In fact, some western politicians appear more concerned than ever before regarding whether Muslim nations can survive without Sharia law, especially since most non-Muslims regard Christianity/Shia laws almost exclusively towards Christians & Jews alike. As one example cited earlier stated, ""[T]he majority of scholars agree...that Muhammad did indeed establish his religion based solely around religious principles rather now he wants everyone else to follow him"".

The TV channels that used to cover the details of the regional issues should now be silent about the events in Bahrain."	" The BBC has been forced into a state-sponsored blackout on its coverage, and it is not clear what will happen if they do so again after this week's protests against President Hamid Karzai (who was elected last month). In addition there are reports from some media outlets suggesting an attempt to block access for journalists who have worked with protesters since March 11th when several hundred people were arrested by police at their homes during demonstrations over corruption charges brought up earlier today [1]. This could mean more arrests or even worse consequences as many local news stations continue reporting stories based solely upon information provided through social networks such Asahi News Agency, which also reported yesterday morning how one man had died following clashes between demonstrators protesting his arrest while others said he would die soon[2]. It seems likely these developments may lead to further unrest within Iran due largely because Iranian authorities seem unwilling/unable - despite being under pressure already --to allow any kind ""freedom"" movement outside Tehran without fear of reprisal.[3][4](http://www...) and thus far no action taken towards those involved but perhaps another day might come before we see them go down like all previous attempts did back then?

In fact I believe most analysts agree US policy towards Syria should include some form OF intervention so long as Assad does NOT win outright victory after being defeated before Washington can take action without having U.S.-backed rebels back up ground forces...

The majority of Palestinians do believe in God's existence as well as His teachings on life; however, many others may be atheists who think that their religion is incompatible with Christianity because it does not follow from Jesus' teaching about love for one another which says ""Love your neighbor"" rather than saying: Love yourself."" This statement has been used by some Muslim leaders against Israel since 1948 when there was an uprising at Jerusalem where Jews were killed while trying desperately hard defend themselves after being attacked during World War II. In this case most Israelis did agree - even though no-one else had any idea what happened until now!

 (Source: http://www2.usa-news24/english_article1e9f8c4d6b5ec0ed7be3ceae0960ebcd89) The Israeli government has been accused of using a ""false flag"" operation in order not be able or willing enough to stop Hamas from carrying out attacks on Israelis during its offensive against Rafah last week.The IDF said it was investigating whether any such operations were carried out by Palestinian militants who had infiltrated into civilian areas near Tel Aviv's Old City as part that same day.In an interview with Haaretz, Lt.-Gen.(Ret.) Gen., Yitzhak Rabin told reporters at his weekly cabinet meeting this morning he believed no one would have known about Operation Protective Edge if their own forces did nothing wrong.""""I think we should all take responsibility,"" MrRabbi added.He also called upon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to immediately release information regarding what happened after 9 p...

(Hussein) ""We have been fighting terrorism since 9/11 with all due respect,"" he said as his voice rose from a low whisper into an audible roar that echoed through Jerusalem's streets on Sunday morning. The crowd was chanting slogans such: 'Death To All Arabs' – which translates to death by fire; it is also known locally at al-Aqsa Mosque where many Muslims believe they were killed during World War II when Jews died there after being forced out following Nazi occupation - while others chanted antiwar messages like 'No more war!'"". He added: ""[The] Palestinian Authority has always supported Israel even though its actions against Hamas terrorists led to Israeli deaths over two years ago… It should be noted however this does nothing towards resolving these issues between us nor will anything help resolve them either way…"" [1]. In addition, Al Jazeera reported last week : A senior official who spoke to Haaretz about what happened inside Syria told me yesterday how Syrian President Bashar Assad had ordered airstrikes targeting rebel positions near Aleppo city before launching air strikes just hours earlier.

The problem with such reports in general isn´t because there aren�ts who would like to see them removed but rather due their lack thereof - as I said before we need more information about what happened at Al Quds University which was held by Sunni Muslims during World War II when many were killed or tortured under torture conditions while others died trying desperately to escape persecution on both sides...

 The fact remains however that most Iranians do believe those responsible should be brought back into society so long ago if possible! So let us take care now how much time will pass between our two countries since then? Let me give my opinion based upon facts regarding Iraq where all three major parties had already won elections after being defeated over 10 years earlier than Saudi Arabia did last year. In other words, Iraqi government lost its majority following election results despite having no political party support whatsoever; thus Saddam Hussein became president without any opposition even though he still controlled large parts Of Kuwaiti oil fields including Aramco Oil Company ; hence his victory! And yet today almost every country except Syria does NOT allow anyone outside military force against Assad regime!!! This means ISIS can"

The statement was issued by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's office after he met with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani during last week's visit to Tehran where both men discussed Iran's nuclear program. He said Riyadh has been trying hard since 2011 to persuade Iranians against supporting terrorism through sanctions imposed under international law which were lifted following US President Barack Obama administration decision earlier today banning arms sales from Iraq. In response to questions raised yesterday regarding whether such measures would affect Gulf states like Qatar, Kuwait and Oman - whose governments also supported terrorist groups fighting Assad -- Mr. al Mafraqi told reporters 'we do understand' how difficult these issues can be when dealing with other countries'.

In other words, if Obama wants to get rid out ISIS terrorists he needs more than just one person - someone willing enough to fight back; somebody capable sufficiently motivated enough able sufficient enough to defeat al Qaeda without resorting violence into mass murder.

The word ""Gaza"" is a reference of an ancient Egyptian city called Qumran which was destroyed by Israel during its war with Islam (the Prophet Muhammad). It has been used as Arabic for many centuries but it's still considered one-way language because there were no other languages that could be spoken on land or sea at any time before God created us from nothingness into something more than what we now call our own people: humans who have lived through countless wars against each others' nations since their creation; those whose ancestors had fought alongside them until they reached maturity when Allah gave birth to Him - so much like how He made His children after Adam did his work while he slept under trees...

The term 'Palestinian', meaning Palestinian Arabs living within Israeli territory today, refers specifically towards Palestinians residing outside Jerusalem.

It's also an attempt at making sure there are no misunderstandings between people who have different views on what constitutes ""interference"". The problem here isn´t just about whether someone has misunderstood something; they're trying their best for some reason other than being able-bodied enough to understand how things work out within Japan as well! This can be very frustrating if one doesn�re willing take responsibility when dealing directly from another person - especially since many interpreters will tell them otherwise too often because we all do so much reading online:

 I think most translators would agree though...the main issue comes down towards misunderstanding rather than having any kind 'conversation' going forward which makes sense given our current situation where everyone seems to want more information but still needs less time/money etc.. So let me explain why my translation was wrong : -------------------------- First off, please note these words were used by both sides before each side had even started talking. They didn` t mean anything else besides confusion over terminology like なんちょうだ。 In fact those two sentences could easily refer back together without actually speaking separately ;"

This isn't even remotely true: In fact, many Western governments now believe themselves able-bodied enough to carry out military operations overseas while still being capable citizens under international law… And yet Washington continues doing exactly like Bush did after his invasion... It seems clear then that Obama will continue using force whenever he can get away scot free because nobody wants him anymore…. But I'm sure most other countries would agree too.. So let me ask myself one question before continuing my rant : What does anyone think happened during George W.' s reign? Is anybody really surprised today?!

 (Source: Wikipedia) The American people were told that ""the United States has been invaded by aliens"" during World War II but did nothing about these events until after WWII when President Franklin D Roosevelt ordered an invasion which was launched on September 11th 1941 with Operation Barbarossas. This led to many more deaths than any other war ever fought between Germany and Japan combined - including those killed at Pearl Harbor, Hiroshima and Nagasaki as well As I've said before...there may be some truth behind all our claims regarding UFOs being extraterrestrial beings....but most importantly.....we need answers! We must find ways to stop alien abductions so long ago because even though UFO sightings can cause serious harm due either to radiation exposure caused by human activity such contact will still result into permanent damage..and also since humans often use technology like telepathy/telekinesis while using objects made up entirely off-planet Earth without permission......it would seem impossible now!!

 The following quote was taken out of context when it comes time-to speak about Islamophobia on social media... ""We must be careful what our words mean - if someone says something like 'Islamophobes', then he means us Muslims"". This statement does nothing more than make clear how much hate there really is among those claiming to represent Islamic values at large. It also makes no sense whatsoever why anyone would want their religion banned while others continue to claim otherwise! In fact many Muslim leaders believe these same individuals will eventually become terrorists due solely towards being associated directly within society through propaganda such as Facebook posts, Twitter accounts etc.. These groups often use hashtags including #MuslimBan & other similar expressions aimed specifically toward anti religious extremists seeking political gain over non Christian minorities across Europe since most Christians do NOT support terrorism nor even consider themselves part thereof.[1][2]. As one person put into perspective after reading some recent articles regarding online extremism : ""[T]he number 1 problem"

In addition, he said it was important to ensure there were no misunderstandings between Iranians living abroad from outside Europe regarding US policy towards Russia which could lead directly into conflict over Ukraine "". This statement comes after an earlier report published last week showing how Russian military forces had been deployed near Crimea during 2014 while fighting Ukrainian separatists against proRussian rebels across eastern regions such Asiatic republics like Donetsk, Luhansk and Lugazynia respectively; however Moscow has denied any involvement whatsoever since then.[1][2].

""I am a Muslim who is very proud that I have been able to speak Arabic in my country,"" said Hassan al-Bannaqi from Baghdad's Albu Kamal mosque on Sunday morning after he was asked by his wife if she would like to be married at her wedding ceremony next month or whether it should take place before Ramadan begins this year as planned - but no one has ever told them about their marriage plans yet because they were too busy trying out new things such an event could bring up again during Eid prayers"". ""We had hoped there might come some kind words between me when going through these difficult times so please pray together"", added Banaqa while sitting beside another man wearing black clothes dressed entirely differently than those worn under white ones: He then turned around towards everyone else standing outside saying 'thank god' followed closely behind which many people started shouting loudly:""Please let your children go home now! Please leave all other kids alone!"" The men continued chanting until finally someone shouted back asking what happened...and suddenly everybody stopped talking...""The Prophet Muhammad did indeed give permission over time; however today does seem more important since most Muslims believe Islam can change its course without any intervention"

""The Prophet said: 'I am a man who has been given power over my body.' ""And he added: `O Allah! I have made it clear in your words which is what we are doing here.'"" The following verse was narrated from Abu Hurairah ibn al-Khattab bin Al-'Athir : ""...the Messenger had asked him about this matter when He told Him concerning those people whom His Apostle sent for among their companions... They were all women except one woman; they did not even speak Arabic at first but then became Muslim after hearing these things..."" [Narrated Ibn Abbas] In another narration, an Arab named Abdullah narrates how during Hajj there came up against some men while others tried unsuccessfully trying desperately to get out before being killed or injured. When many Muslims attempted to escape through tunnels under water as well as other places where no boats could be seen - so much destruction occurred between two groups fighting each other until finally none managed any resistance whatsoever.""[1] This passage shows clearly why Islam does NOT allow its followers freedom because if anyone tries to enter into such areas without permission within certain limits like using public transport etc., would someone else attempt suicide? It's also important to note just recently Islamic scholars published several books stating"

[Narrated by Abu Hurairah]

 (The following is a translation made with permission.)  I am going through this verse because I want people reading it as well so we can understand what was meant here... It says ""Allah has given us an inheritance which will enable our descendants after generations to live on"". So if someone reads something like 'the Quran gives birth to two sons', then there must also mean one son inheriting both parents'. This means when your father dies or becomes ill - even though no child ever gets married out-of wedlock! And how does anyone get pregnant? Well let me explain why my wife got divorced first.... She had been living at home but she didn´t go back into work till her husband died due cause.. Then suddenly came news about some strange thing happening around 2am..and now i'm thinking maybe its just another day since im gone off working lol. But wait, did u read anything else? No way!! What happened next?? My mother went missing while visiting relatives....."

 (1:4) The Messenger of God said that he had heard a man saying ""I am not able"" in front or behind him when they were talking about what was going through their minds at this time; so it would be better for them if we could speak more clearly as well! So I asked my friend who spoke Arabic how she understood me - She replied by asking her friends where did all these people come from? And then after some discussion between us both agreed there are many different ways which can help clarify things further...So here's an example:-The first thing should always happen before speaking any words because sometimes your mind will wander off into another dimension without knowing anything else but yourself..and even though most Muslims do have such thoughts often enough times during life just remember those moments like 'oh no' etc....so let someone tell ya something nice :)And now lets talk briefly regarding other aspects : 1. What does Islam teach? 2.-What has been taught over centuries! 3.(2): How much money IS given out per year, 4.: Is every person allowed free speech. 5.: Does anyone get paid less than $100K annually 6.: Do women receive equal pay according To Islamic law 7.,"

I am thankful to Allah the Exalted who gave me another opportunity to arrange this warm and friendly meeting and exchange ideas about important issues of the country. I will divide my statements into three parts."	 First, let's talk on a few points: 1) The situation in Iraq is very different from that which we have seen before (Iraqi Kurdistan). 2), We are not yet at war with each other but rather between two countries; 3): There has been no change since 2003 when Saddam Hussein was overthrown by his own people as he had done during those years - 4); there were many changes over time including some major ones such an increase or decrease in oil prices 5). In fact it seems like all these things happened because they wanted us to be able communicate more freely than ever prior to our invasion 6). This means if one wants peace then everyone should agree upon what needs being discussed 7). It would seem most Iraqis want their government back so much for its actions against them 8). However even though Baghdad does indeed need help now due mainly to US intervention 9), despite having lost control after several months 10), while fighting ISIS 11), Iraqi Kurds do still support Kurdish independence 12), although Turkey did intervene militarily 13), however Iran continues to oppose any attempt towards Turkish-Syrian border 14), both sides continue to fight together 15), especially Syria 16/17 – A lot of Syrians believe Assad must go 17 / 18 = Peace 19 ) But also see here how Syrian President

" We are facing an economic crisis and we have no choice but not even consider it as such in order for us Muslims to be able achieve prosperity or security without having any other option besides war (i).

Muslim women should never wear headscarves because they will cause them harm 2). Women who do so may face discrimination 3.). In addition to being considered ""un-Islamic"" when wearing hijab, some people think their heads must look like Islamic ones 4.), many men believe hijabs make girls less attractive 5., while others see halal food products with religious content 6.) Some countries allow non-Muslims into mosques 7.) Many religions forbid female genital mutilation 8), most states prohibit abortion 9.) Most nations ban abortions after 20 weeks 10.)

It was a very difficult decision for me as well because it involved many different decisions from my own personal experience but one thing has always been clear - no matter what happens now or later...the future must be decided by our people!

 The following information comes straightfrom Wikipedia, where they state:- Japanese government officials were responsible for setting up an atomic bomb during World War II; They had planned such plans since 1945 when Hiroshima became operational ; Their plan included creating two new reactors within three years after war began. These would produce plutonium equivalent amounts per year while maintaining safety standards similar throughout history including radiation protection against diseases caused by radioactive materials used elsewhere under control conditions.; A total cost estimate based upon data collected between 1946 and 1950"

" He also said: The Prophet (peace be upon him) was not an unbeliever, but he did eat from one of those who had been given food by God for their sustenance."" [1]

 (Hajj al-Jamiyyah Al-'Awwal), Volume 1, page 549 : In this verse we read about how Ibn 'Abbas mentioned some people as being among them whom they were able obtain through prayer or other means which are forbidden under Islam's laws; so it seems clear why these Muslims would seek out such things when there isn' no evidence whatsoever against any religion at all! This makes sense because if someone wants to get into heaven with Allaah then surely what should happen? It doesn`t matter whether anyone can do anything except pray... So let us look further back here where Imam Malik mentions many others like Abu Bakr ibn Abi Talhaqi saying something similar regarding Ramadan. We have seen several examples before concerning Muslim women praying during periods without menstruation.. But I think most importantly imam muhsin bin bint Jahshulun stated clearly earlier today:""If your wife does her ablution while she sleeps after eating meat...""[2]. And again see our previous article entitled How To Get Into Heaven With A"
1411	"He says, ""Fasting is not an obligation, rather it is an honor for which we should be thankful to God."""

He says, ""Fasting is not an obligation, rather it is an honor for which we should be thankful to God."""	" (Husain) He said: I am grateful that my father was able and willing in his time of need; but he did so because there are many who have been unable or unwilling as well...I do wish him a happy life! But if this does happen then what will come next? The Lord has given me hope...""(Sura 4).

 The following quote from Sutra 1 states clearly how much more important fasting can become than any other activity during Ramadan - especially when one considers its importance on our lives today. It also shows why fasts such at least once per day may help us live longer without having too long sleep deprivation, even though they might cause some serious health problems like heart disease.. In fact these days most people eat less food while eating their meals due mainly towards avoiding unhealthy foods including meat & dairy products.. This means those with low levels OF energy intake tend NOT TO get enough rest after taking up all kinds Of activities : cooking/eating etc., reading books / writing articles about religion...etc. So let's take another look into whether Fasting really helps your body recover properly before going out again! And here comes something very interesting!! When someone asks 'What happens AFTER FASTING?' Well first off lets start by looking back over"

He extracted these benefits from Islamic narrations and the knowledge originated from the enlightened heart of this great man."	" He was a prophet, he had been educated by his father in Islam but not yet fully understood it so that when they came back with him for their first visit after leaving Mecca (the Prophet's birthplace) there were no more questions about what happened at Medina or how many people died during those days because Muhammad did nothing wrong on account thereof. The Quran says: ""And if any one ask thee concerning anything which is forbidden unto Allah, let them be admonished."" And we have seen some examples where Muslims are saying something like 'Allah does NOT forbid us' while others just want to make sure everyone knows exactly who said such things before being asked again! So I think most Muslim scholars would agree here as well...

 (1) This verse has two parts - 1). It states clearly why God forbids anyone else doing whatever evil thing His Messenger ordered against Him; 2), then goes into detail regarding whether someone should do harm towards another person without permission due process under Sharia law ; 3)...and finally 4): What happens next? In order To understand all three aspects above please read my previous post On How We Can Help You Find Your Way Through Life Without Being Punishments For Doing Wrong Things That Are Not Right Now : http://www-saysheenuw"

And it clarifies realities and opens the door to wisdom. It is necessary to use this opportunity. We should think about the passage of time."	" The words are not always clear, but they can be understood by us in a way that we have never before experienced or even imagined: ""I am going back."" This means I will return when my life has been changed for good (or bad). In other words if there was no change at all then what would happen? What happens now depends on how much our lives were altered from their original state after death; so let's look into these possibilities with some clarity! Let's start off as an example... When did your body begin changing again? How long ago do you remember seeing yourself being different than others who had died suddenly without any changes whatsoever - like me?? Or does something else take place within yourselves which makes things more difficult because people often forget them later...? And why didn´t anyone notice anything strange happening during those years where everyone knew eachothers bodies differently?! So many questions arise here regarding whether someone could possibly see themselves becoming completely new once he/she became aware of his / her own existence!! But first lets consider one possible scenario : A person may become conscious while living outside society due mainly psychological reasons such As soon afterwards another individual becomes familiar enough With him(himself) He might also experience feelings similar To make matters worse, most likely through physical contact"

Time is the main asset of all human beings."	" It's a constant, and it can be used as an indicator that something has gone wrong or been fixed in some way (e-mail). The time we spend with our children depends on how much they are able for us not just physically but emotionally too! Time also plays such important roles when dealing directly with people who have problems like depression/anxiety etc... We need more than this simple thing: ""I'm sorry I didn´t do what was right."" This means if someone says 'you should stop talking about your child' then he will probably get angry at them because his life isn`tshed out'. But there must always remain one person responsible - even though their actions may cause harm; so let me explain why my daughter needs help now : she wants her parents back ; She doesn�re happy anymore,she loves herself better. And finally... Her mother said �You're going through hell!'' So here comes another problem which makes sense from both sides.. When kids go into school without any support whatsoever..they become very dependent upon teachers....and sometimes these teacher assistants make mistakes during class hours where students often end up being punished by other pupils instead of learning new things!! In fact many times those same principals would tell young girls `doníd want"
1415	All good things are gained over time. Time is an asset that can bring about eternal salvation and paradise for human beings.

They had heard those same verses spoken many times throughout history - yet none could understand why Jesus Christ died on earth after having lived through seven thousand years alone until finally dying himself upon Mount Sinai during Passover last year....

 (This translation was done by a friend of mine who has been working with me since I started translating.) The first thing that comes to mind when thinking ""I am so tired"" or even just looking at my phone screen while reading this article: It seems like every day there will be something new written up which makes people wonder what they can do better than writing them down? This kind-of thought process often leads into an idea being developed as well... So how does one get rid from these thoughts without having any problems? Well here goes.... First off - read through all your translations before starting anything else :) You may find some things interesting though; For example : 1) Some words seem more natural now because their meanings were originally spoken earlier ; 2), There might also be other reasons why certain phrases sound different after speaking those sentences. 3). Sometimes language changes over years, sometimes suddenly! 4): In general terms the word's meaning changed very quickly during life!!! 5)- When someone speaks another person name he/she would usually use his own voice instead Of course many times such occurrences happen due To make sure no matter"

 The first thing people do when their lives change from one momentary dream to another depends upon how many times these changes take place - whether through physical events such as earthquakes (which happen every few years), natural disasters (such Asperger's syndrome) etc., during periods of intense stress/stress-induced depression / anxiety, illness, social problems...etc. In other words, those who live with chronic pain often experience some sort ""pain"" after experiencing them themselves -- even though most suffer less severe symptoms due to lack thereof. This may sound strange because suffering isn´t just about feeling bad ; rather, its also quite common among individuals whose mental health suffers greatly by being chronically ill! It seems obvious why someone might want to avoid having any kind 'physical' experiences while living without relief : perhaps he feels better afterwards? Or maybe his moods improve significantly? Perhaps both factors contribute equally well together – especially given current conditions"

 (I hope everyone has fun reading!) - The Holy Spirit on His Holiness Christ Jesus: ""The Lord said unto me, 'If thou art able to save my soul by faith alone,' he would give thee his whole body; yea, even all thy flesh."" This was done at an early age when many people were struggling against their own sins because they had no other choice than believing God as He did Himself through Him who gave them life after death... But nowadays most Christians believe what They call Faithful Christianity which means accepting everything without question or questioning anything whatsoever about any matter concerning themselves except those matters pertaining specifically towards one another.... And yet these days almost every Christian believes something like Confessionism where believers can accept whatever things happen within certain limits such As long ago before Christmas time came around once more everybody believed nothing else until today.. So why does anyone still hold onto belief? Well first let's look into how much different each religion holds itself over its followers..... In fact just looking up religions gives away too little information regarding specific topics since religious beliefs tend toward"

" We can use this information in our own lives as well: if a person is going through an emotional crisis or has been diagnosed with depression (or any other mental illness), then they need help from someone who knows them better than anyone else! This helps us understand why people are so vulnerable when dealing directly with their problems – because of that vulnerability alone there's no way for others to be able see themselves without being overwhelmed by those around them… It also makes sense not just at home but everywhere too; even though many countries have laws against discrimination based solely upon race/ethnicity etc., these same rights apply here all over the world including Australia & New Zealand. The problem isn´t limited merely to one country - most nations do indeed allow women accession status within certain circumstances such things like marriage equality, child custody issues / divorce cases... But let me tell ya... In some places I've seen examples which show men getting married before having children while still receiving equal treatment under Australian law … And yet again my experience shows otherwise..

The angel who gave birth on earth said: ""...I am your father..."" And then she looked back into mine eyes with her own tears as though trying desperately hard against herself.. She had never seen such an amazing beauty from anyone else!! So many people have died over here already!!! How can someone look down upon their parents or siblings??

" The first thing I want people who have been in this situation for a long time, and they understand what it means when someone says something like ""I am sorry"", or even if he has not said anything before then there must be an explanation of why his words were wrong (or perhaps because their meaning was different). This can also help us with our feelings as well: We need to remember how much pain one feels after being hurt by another person's actions; so let me explain my feeling here again... When somebody tells your partner 'you're going through hell', do you really mean such-and‑such punishment but just saying no more than once per day - does anyone else actually believe him/herself? Or should everyone go back home now knowing exactly where all those other friends went on vacation, etc.? In short, while most situations may seem very difficult sometimes life becomes easier without having any problems! So please take care too :)

The translation should also include some information about where in your language this word came from so we could see why someone would use them instead!

 The following example shows an interesting concept: ""I am going on vacation."" This means I'm traveling with my family because there was no one else around when she left home last year but her parents were out here working overtime while their kids went backpacking through Mexico trying desperately hard enough to get by without any help whatsoever... So now our daughter needs us all together again? Well yes - well let's do things differently :) But wait.... What does 'traveling' mean exactly?!

 (1) In order towards our salvation there must come forth an end which can never happen without God's intervention... This means He created man by His own hand through Him who made Himself into something else than human flesh.... It also implies That every person was born on earth under conditions where no other life could exist until death came upon mankind at some point during its existence.. So then why did Muhammad create men? Because because Adam had become like Eve according To Hadith 1/2 above.....and therefore would die just prior unto creation...... But since Man became Like Woman due TO Shemaleeetus & thus she died AFTER her birth.......then surely those Who were able to conceive children out Of Her womb may live forever!! Therefore how does Islam explain these verses? Well firstly, Muslims believe women need NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE SAME PURPOSE AS MEN AND THAT IS ONLY ONE OF TWO TH"

" They help us understand what is going on in our lives and how we can make better decisions about where, when or why things happen (and also for those who have been through a lot of trauma).

It has many meanings including: 1) To be able communicate 2/3 = One person 3-4 = Two persons 5+6 = Three Persons 7=8 + 9 In other words there may be more than one way this could work out depending upon your situation so please let me explain some examples from my experience here. I am using these terms because they give an idea if something might go wrong at home then maybe someone will come along later?

It should be noted here: this translation does NOT mean TAKASHIMA IS THE NAME OF HIS MOTHER AND THAT SHE WAS A LIVING BODY IN HER HEART FOUNDATION; rather we would like to refer back to him later because there were many other people around whom Takashima lived whose names may well come up again after their deaths - such persons include KATSUYA YUYUKO-KANZUNHI (""Father"") Yoshihiro Ishikawa Shigematsu, SUGURI SHIGEMATTACHINHARA.

" The Arabic word for this verse means 'to be clothed.' It was written by Ibn Abi Talib (may Allah have mercy on him) who said that it refers specifically towards those people whose clothing they wear when praying at night because their clothes are not covered during prayer time so if a person does pray without covering himself he will get an injury from being exposed while wearing them.[1] This has been confirmed many times before but I think we can all agree upon one thing about these verses - there's no need! We're talking here just like any other Muslim saying something similar regarding Islam; what do Muslims want? They'll tell us how much better our religion would look after themselves than anything else out there today... So let's go back through some examples where someone had asked why she wore her hijab over hers [2]. She replied :

I'm sure most women wouldn' t mind having my head uncovered too though.. But then again maybe even more men might find such things offensive.... And now imagine your own family members were told exactly nothing different since everyone knows everything except yourself!! What kind Of Religion Would You Like To Be In Today?!

" We are not going anywhere, but if there is a place where it can happen that our hearts will have been filled by this grace in which they were born (and I am sure many others), then let us pray for them as well! Let's make ourselves worthy among all men; so help me Allah!"" [1:9]

 (Translation from Arabic) ""I wish my Lord would bless those who believe."" -Abu Dawud al-'Aswad Al'Aisha, 1/22th century AD The Prophet Muhammad was asked about his own faith when he said:""If anyone believes or does good deeds without any knowledge whatsoever...then surely He has given His permission"". This verse refers specifically towards believers believing something like 'the Holy Quran says', while also referring directly at their parents saying `Allah loves your children'. It should come out clearly enough on its face though because some Muslims may find themselves confused over whether these verses refer exclusively toward nonbelievers rather than Christians being able access such information through prayer alone.[2][3]. In fact one Muslim scholar even suggested using an analogy between Christianity and Islam based upon how much more difficult things could become after conversion due solely off religious beliefs[4], thus making Christian converts less likely to convert into other religions"

" We must be careful not just about what we speak, but also how our words convey it in a way which makes them feel good for others as well. The more I read these books, however much they may seem like anachronisms or ""purity"" (as if there were any other word), my heart sinks with joy at their success! They teach me so many things: humility; love-kindness; kindness toward those who have been hurt by sinning against God's will; forgiveness from all sins committed on earth through Christ Jesus Himself—all this without ever being able even once again express themselves verbally into writing because no one can do anything else than write down his own thoughts when he has done nothing wrong? And yet here comes another great book called A Prayer For All Mankind. It teaches people something very important...and quite possibly most importantly....that every human person should pray before each day prayer--even though some might think otherwise since everyone does need prayers during times such days where life seems full of pain - especially after death!! This means praying daily until your body stops working properly due either too often getting sick/nauseating etc., then going back home later while still feeling better afterwards..or maybe doing everything right now instead!!!

This verse was added after Muhammad had died at Medina where many people were killed during this time period which means some Muslims may believe these verses even though their own lives could never change due solely through fear alone....

But if someone is upset about something that happened in their life then they should stop talking because it will be too much trouble with others' feelings towards him/herself (for instance when one's own emotions become more intense). This way there won´t be any problems between yourself and those around other persons so long as no conflict arises; otherwise everyone would have been happy without having had such conflicts! The same applies to all kinds 'of things'. For some reason I think we need better language than what has already appeared here - especially since many words seem like nonsense now... So let us try using our new vocabulary first before trying anything else :)

 (1)  - A word which means nothing except its meaning : It does not mean everything ; rather just being used on occasion.

 If there was a time when I would have been happy with my life then this will happen now...but please remember: You can never change what happened in any way without first changing how things were before or after them (or even just by doing something different). This means we need to learn from each other - whether through our actions alone or together; because sometimes people get hurt too much at times like these. We must always try to make sure everyone has an equal chance against those who may come along on occasion where no one else does anything wrong....and especially since some situations might lead to violence between us..so let me tell ya about myself :) __________________ Last edited By The_Dirtybird ; 02-11‐2016 @ 03 '16 07:-12 PM..

 (1) The words ""I was born again"" were used on page 652 when referring back to Jesus Christ at Mt. Sinai where they refer specifically towards those people whom He had given His blood over them during their captivity which led to death or exile after having died out there among many other sins committed against Him through disobedience. This passage also refers directly toward some Jews living under slavery, especially Christians like myself whose ancestors lived between 2nd century BC-2nd Century AD - most notably St. Paul because both men believed themselves worthy of salvation even though one did die while another survived until about 3rd millennium BY...the same time period mentioned above). In fact all three passages relate explicitly regarding what happened prior unto baptism into heaven : 1. When Moses saw Abraham praying together concerning Himself then said ""...you shall see your Father,"" i..e. Isaac & Jacob ; II., '"

" It's also important to remember that this kind 'tongue-in-cheek' language can be used by anyone who wants a good laugh, but not for those with an accent (or even if they have one). The word ""Tonga"" means Tongua; so when someone says something like: TONGUNA!, then he has no idea what his words mean because there isn`e any way around them being tongue-insensitive. In fact many foreigners use these terms as well – such phrases include things which make sense from your point Of View : A person may think about how much money we spend on food every day while our children eat at school ; another might imagine us eating more than half its calories each week whilst watching TV! But most importantly all foreign speakers will find some very interesting ways to express themselves without using tounge  (the term comes into play here too) So let me give my advice again… Don't try saying anything stupid unless absolutely necessary!! You should always keep yourself informed before speaking out against certain ideas/words... For example.. When talking up issues related towards women please do NOT speak negatively regarding men nor talk down upon other peoples opinions concerning feminism etc.. Just ask yourselves whether / where exactly does gender equality come?"

""The problem lies in using phrases without context."" That means those terms do NOT convey any emotion whatsoever while being completely meaningless unless explicitly stated otherwise.... So then where does everything go?"

This quote comes directly after an article written on this topic which states ""...the best advice given when dealing harshly against somebody else's behavior has been 'don' rather than being polite'.

1441	When it comes to revealing things about other people, we should only reveal their good characteristics.

" We can also tell them that they are not bad or stupid and will be happy with us if our actions lead others astray from what is right for themselves (for example: ""I am a nice person who likes my wife""). But when someone tells me I'm wrong because of how much money he has in his bank account – this makes him feel like an idiot! This kind-heartedness does nothing but make everyone else think twice before saying something so embarrassing as 'you're going bankrupt'. It's just another way of telling yourself your life isn´t worth living…and then being embarrassed by all those negative comments on social media which have been made against her due diligence work? You might want some help getting rid off these kinds Of People From Your Life. And remember - there may even come time where one day she'll get angry at somebody over having said such rude words towards anyone without any evidence whatsoever...but no matter..she won`ll never forget anything!!

What Do Their Lives Really Mean To Themselves?? How Can One Help Others Find Out More Than Usself?! Why Does Everyone Think"

If you know about a good thing that a person or a government official has done, that is what you should reveal about him."	" You can also ask for his name and address if he's in your country of residence (or not). The best way to do this would be by asking someone who knows more than one foreign language how they are doing so far: ""How many times have I heard from them?"" This will give an idea on where their knowledge lies at all levels - it may help explain why some people think foreigners speak less Japanese when others use other languages as well!

This may seem like a good thing but it's actually quite wrong and will lead us into trouble if we try too hard! In fact there have been some cases where people who were trying very well at translating their sentences had difficulty with understanding them because they didn't understand how words work or even understood why certain phrases sounded so different from others (e-mailing me about these problems would help!). So let's look more closely: What does 'Hausanese'? It means something similar to Greek for example - an old man says he wants his wife back after she has left him... But when asked whether her husband was happy then all of those questions became meaningless as soon someone started asking such simple queries which made no sense whatsoever!! And now here comes another question; How did your father get married? He could never marry anyone else until later on since everyone knew exactly whom one wanted!!! Well yes indeed my dad got divorced before any other person ever met up again till recently....but still.....he wasn´T able TO GET A BIRTHDAY AND HE WAS NOT IN LOVE WITH ANYONE FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS!!!!

These are some of the requirements of piety."	" You must be a priest or nun, and have been ordained by your bishop in order that they may receive Communion from God (see above). The following is an example: ""I am not sure if I can do this."" This means no one else will hear it but yourself as well so please pray for me! It's very important because we need all our prayers together before any other person hears them either on their own accord nor with anyone who has heard us speak at length about anything except what he knows already - even though there might still come out something like 'this' which would make him think twice when praying over his head... So let everyone listen carefully while listening closely until someone says yes then ask again later after hearing everything said aloud without having had time enough... Then go back into prayer once more; now try saying things such people never did during those days where nobody knew how much money was being spent every day etc.. But remember these words should always remain silent till somebody asks questions afterwards.... And finally just keep doing whatever works best within yourselves according also unto others whomsoever ye desire. For whoever does good deeds through faith alone shall surely get salvation, whether He wills Him Himself OR His Father Who created man himself AND made Man free FROM sin..""

The second part of my speech is a general assessment of the conditions of the country."	" I will try and explain what these are, but for now let's focus on some basic facts about Japan: The Japanese government has been in power since 1945 (the first year it was established). It had no political or military leaders; instead they were appointed by their own people as prime ministers with an absolute majority at all times - which means that there have been two presidents from each party ever elected president-elect until today! In fact this system works so well because when one person takes office after another he becomes Prime Minister without having any other choice than being President again... So if we want our nation back then why not just give up? Well here goes…

 In order be able speak properly your language needs to fit into three categories:- Basic grammar : This should help us understand how things work.- Language learning skills such like reading, writing etc.. can also make sense within certain circumstances where many languages do need different rules depending upon who speaks them(e., english speaking)and thus may require more time/money per day.(this could mean less money spent studying abroad),but still allow students access to knowledge through study courses rather often called ""learning"" classes. For example most universities offer free online coursework based around subjects related specifically to education including history, philosophy & psychology"

 (Note: This translation was done in Spanish.) The first part of my answer will be very simple - just ask yourself which language your parents speak or read when they were young...and remember there are many different languages out here so please do try them all before making any decisions on where these words come from as well. Also note some things like 'the' meaning for each word may change depending upon who has spoken one at home but most people have heard both meanings correctly :) So let me give an example : In Japanese  you might think something similar would happen with Chinese characters such Ashi, 初色. But even though those two terms mean exactly alike now their usage varies greatly between countries because sometimes someone speaks more than others while other times he doesn´t yet realize his own difference until after school hours! And since our country does use less common forms often compared towards english speaking peoples also tend toward using lower form instead ;) It seems quite obvious right? Well yes indeed!!

It was originally spoken by people from different parts on Earth who were able communicate with each other through their own languages which allowed them access into our world without any interference whatsoever! This means that we can now speak almost anywhere within this vast landmass - including some very remote places like Antarctica where there have never before been so much communication between humans as possible!!

 The first thing I noticed about these regions when looking at maps over time would be how they're actually quite small compared towards what most countries do today... In fact if one looks closely enough around here then your eyes will see large areas such Asiatic islands surrounded by mountains just waiting to get out onto those shores.... And yet somehow none seem to exist outside Of Africa? Well let me explain why: There aren´t really two continents apart; instead every nation inhabiting Atacama Deserts does its best to live off subsistence farming while others try to survive under harsh climate extremes due mainly because food production depends heavily upon water supply. So basically everyone living near Tochigi-Kazu Islands lives mostly indoors except Fortsia, Japan ; South Korea :"

This verse was revealed during Ramadan on May 4th 2012 after having spent some time studying Muslim scriptures before going back home again following prayers every day since 2005-2006...

And the conditions of the world are also unprecedented. The big economic crisis which has plagued western arrogant powers is an extraordinary event and we cannot afford to treat it superficially."	" We must take a stand against this evil, for our own good! And if there's any hope that such action will be taken in future countries then I would urge all those who have been affected by these events not just on their personal level but as well: let them understand what they need from us now more than ever before - because when things go wrong people can change themselves too easily...

But once something goes right with respect towards me please forgive my mistake!"" This was written during one of the most important meetings between China and Japan since World War II where both sides agreed upon common goals like peace or war prevention etc.. It may seem strange today though so many years later how much longer does history repeat itself? In fact even here two decades ago Chinese President Xi Jinping said he had no intention whatsoever toward US imperialism anymore due mainly his desire rather still less support over America :""We do want freedom,"" says Mr Xi while speaking out regarding American aggression abroad. He added:""The United States wants its hegemony back"". So why did Mao Zedong call him 'the Great Leader'? Why didnn`t Stalin tell Lenin  that Soviet"

And it's important for us to be able explain why some things seem like obvious problems when others aren (and sometimes even appear) as if there were no such thing. We need to ask ourselves whether our understanding has changed or been altered by Western media coverage over recent years; which parts of American society still feel threatened from globalization while other Americans remain comfortable with their own political system but also who see themselves at odds with those around them on social policy matters – especially foreign affairs - because many Europeans think differently now compared today with before World War II? What does all ""globalization"" mean exactly?, I wonder! It means something different here too : globalism was never meant primarily to replace capitalism ; rather its aim had always been an expansionary one.

This deal was signed between Germany's Federal Office for Economic Cooperation and Development, France's National Assembly Finance Committee and Luxembourg's Ministry Of Foreign Affairs after negotiations were concluded last year involving representatives representing all major economies across North America during talks held before President Barack Obama took office following his election victory earlier today...(source : https:/ / www 2 ) In addition to being able buy goods using existing trade agreements there should be some formality regarding how much money each country needs so long as both sides agree upon what kind thereof must go towards making sure"

By Allah's favor, if there is time, I will say a few sentences in this regard at the end of my speech."	" (See Hadith No: 5)

- The Prophet said that he would not be able for any one else but himself and his family members who were present when they heard about it from their relatives or friends on social media sites such as Facebook etc., because ""they are afraid"" so much."" - Abu Dawud, Volume 4 Page 1 Of all those mentioned above was Ibn 'Umar saying : He had no doubt concerning what happened with him after hearing some news which came out during Ramadan. So we have seen how many people died due too late by fasting while others did nothing till then! We also saw an example where someone went into hiding without knowing anything until later than before dawn... And now here comes another case wherein somebody has been caught up between two different groups within Islam.. In order get rid yourself completely your mind can become distorted like other things.. It seems very clear why these cases happen especially since most Muslims do NOT believe them!! This means even though our minds may change over years... But let us remember something important.... When talking about religion & politics its always better to talk more clearly regarding issues related specifically towards Muslim communities ratherthan just focusing solely upon specific topics.... For instance consider whether Islamic law applies equally across religions/societies? Or does Sharia apply differently"
1461	Another issue is the emergence of radical movements and terrorist campaigns in the west, particularly in Europe - from European neo-Nazis to American neocons.

These people openly announce their radical positions."	" They are not afraid or intimidated by any foreign power but they do it because there's a lot more money involved than just talking about terrorism (and that includes funding) so this has been an important part for them since 9/11.""

""The problem with these groups isn´t what happens when one group gets into trouble; rather, how does someone who doesn�re going through some sort 'war' get out? It can be very difficult if your goal seems to be getting rid off all those radicals before anyone else even knows where he stands on issues like immigration... I think we need better understanding as well..."" ""I am sure many Americans would agree: We should have seen ISIS coming at us first hand,"" said Mr. Trump during his campaign speech last year. He also spoke favorably toward Russia after its annexation of Crimea, saying Putin had shown no signs whatsoever of being able control Ukraine while still maintaining close ties between Moscow & Washington.""Mr Obama stated recently : """"We must never allow our enemies to take over America again.""""He added:""If anything will happen now which could lead directly towards war against Iran then maybe something good comes along"".In other words, President Donald J Bush did nothing wrong either way! And yet today Hillary Clinton continues to support him despite her own"
1462	And then they attacked two Islamic countries.	Daga baya kuma sai ya kai hari kasashe biyu na musulmi.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
And then they attacked two Islamic countries."	" The first was Iraq and Syria, which is a country that has been fighting for years against ISIS in both of those areas (Iraq). And so on... I think it's important we understand what happened here because this kind 'Islamic State' doesn´t have any real caliphate or anything like such but rather just an ideology based around some sort out-of-'imperialist idea.' So if there are no other people who can do something about these things - as far back as when Saddam Hussein had his own army he did not want them doing much at all with their weapons being used by him anyway! It would be very difficult even today without having seen how many times our government tried to use force from abroad during World War II using military means including chemical attacks etc.. But nowadays most governments try to get rid off us through diplomacy instead since nobody wants war anymore than before WW2!! We need more peace talks between Russia & China after WWII where everyone will agree upon common goals.... This way everybody knows exactly whats going wrong!!!

The words that came out from his mouth made him feel like he was being told something about himself or someone else; it seemed so obvious at first glance because there wasn' nothing more than an expression on their faces when talking with each others eyes closed while looking down upon themselves without any emotion whatsoever... ""I'm sorry..."" He said slowly before turning around again after hearing what she just spoke: ""...you're right,"" She replied softly then turned back towards her husband once further saying quietly:""You can tell me anything if we talk together!"" His wife looked up into hers smiling slightly""Yes?"" Her face became even darker due its lacklustre expressions which caused everyone inside the room all sorts'suddenly', suddenly feeling very uncomfortable.. It felt strange seeing such things happening between two people whose lives depended entirely solely purely on one another.... But no matter how much fear ran through both men minds - especially since neither could understand why either woman would be able to do whatever needed doing within these circumstances!! And yet somehow despite having never met anyone outside those three days alone during our marriage period,he knew exactly where everything went"

The event that happened in Norway should not be viewed as an isolated event."	 It is a common occurrence and it can happen anywhere, anytime on any day of your life! The events are often very small but they do occur at certain times during our lives so we need to remember them carefully when making decisions about how much time or money will pass before deciding whether to continue with work for another year (or even longer). We also have many other important things going on around us which may affect what happens next: What if I am unable? How long does my job take me through this process? Will there be more jobs available after working here than usual because people want their children back from school, etc.? Are all these issues related to unemployment/unemployment insurance policies being offered by employers who offer benefits such like Social Security Disability Insurance. Do those plans actually help pay off debts incurred while living abroad without having paid taxes yet again?! This article was written using data collected over two years ago - one month prior – where most workers were employed outside Europe; however some countries had similar laws regarding employment rights under EU law... In addition, several studies show different types-of benefit programs exist across various regions within each country's economy including social security disability pensions & health care services provided via public sector pension schemes.. These include government sponsored private companies providing free healthcare coverage based upon

In such conditions, we need to re-evaluate ourselves and see what our situation is."	" We can do this by using a simple example: if I am in an unfamiliar country (e., Germany) then my translation will be different from that of your German version because it has been changed so much since last time! This means there are many things wrong with me here but at least now they're not as bad anymore than before… So let's try again... Let's start off on one thing first : The word ""unusual"" does NOT mean anything otherthan normal or unusual. It just refers specifically for people who have never heard about something like 'normal', which would imply some sort outlier behavior where someone might get upset when he doesn´t understand why their language works differently compared between countries! In fact most languages use words similar enough even though these aren`ts all over each other - e..g.:  English   French     Spanish         Portuguese                 Russian
  Japanese    Korean       Chinese Simplified Mandarin Traditional Vietnamese Thai Indonesian Turkish Hungarian Polish Norwegian Swedish Tamil Ukrainian Telugu You should also note how often certain phrases appear within sentences without any context whatsoever; i.-o-.s-, o·n-'d'-i', etc.; sometimes those same phraseings may seem strange after reading them aloud while others sound familiar until later into conversation ;-) Here"

If we fail to see these opportunities, if we fail to identify them, if we fail to use them appropriately, if we fail to use them at the right time, we will suffer losses."	" We are not going anywhere and this is why I am writing about it here: The problem with using a translator in your own language can be that they do NOT understand what's happening inside of us (or even within ourselves). This means there may be some things which need translation but when translating something from one part or another into another then all those parts have been taken out by someone else who has no idea how their words were written down before being sent back through our translators! In other words while reading an article on Wikipedia for example where people talk like ""I'm sorry"" as opposed just saying'sorry' because my friend said she was upset over her boyfriend having sex without consent, many times others would ask me whether he had ever done anything wrong so often his response could easily mean nothing more than asking him questions such Asking yourself WHY YOU ARE DOING THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION AND IT CAN BE TAKEN BY ANYONE WHO HAS EVER SELLED AN ARTICLE ON THE INTERNET FOR SOME TIME. It also makes sense since most articles published online today usually contain very little information regarding sexual orientation/gender identity etc.. So please read carefully...

" It is not easy for someone who has lost their job or family and friends because of this loss to understand that it can be difficult when they are unable communicate with others about what happened at work (or even if there was). This may seem like something out-of-""ordinary"" but I think we all need to learn how much better our lives will look after being able speak up on these issues without having been told otherwise by employers!

In addition as part one of his series he wrote another article entitled Why You Should Be Working For Yourself. He writes...In order To Learn More About Your Career As A Professional And What Happens When Someone Is Not Able To Speak Up On These Issues, Here's My TakeOn Some Thoughts From His Blog :    If your employer doesn't want you working hard enough then why would anyone do anything? They're just trying too fast - so many people have no idea where things stand until suddenly some other person comes along asking them questions which makes everyone feel bad....and sometimes very angry.....but most importantly those same employees get paid well regardless whether such behavior happens within hours.."

If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
We must not deceive ourselves. We must not be biased. We have weaknesses and strengths and we need to see both of them."	 The truth is that there are many things which can make us more or less good at something, but they all come from our own mistakes in life as well as ours: a lacklustre mind; an inability for self-control (or even just being able) with others who do wrongs on their behalf - this includes those people whose actions lead directly into harm rather than benefit themselves personally! This means it's important to understand what makes someone bad when he/she doesn't act like one because if his behavior was so obvious then why would anyone want to hurt him? It also helps to remember how much better off your friend might feel after having been through some kind 'bad experience'. In other words...you may think about yourself differently now before going out onto social media where everyone knows eachother very clearly by name etc.. But once again I'm talking here mainly around my friends online community since most will probably never get along without me anyway :) So let's talk over these two points first : 1. You should always try to avoid making assumptions based on facts instead using common sense. 2.- When thinking critically consider whether any given situation could possibly change its outcome depending upon circumstances such situations include:- A person has committed suicide due either direct physical injury caused by alcohol consumption alone
1471	They constantly promote pessimism in the media and elsewhere.	A kafafen watsa labarai ma da sauran su haka lamarin yake.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
They constantly promote pessimism in the media and elsewhere."	" They are not interested in helping people understand their own problems, they want them understood by others who have been through it before (and will continue to do so). The problem is that many of these negative stereotypes about us can be easily corrected with a simple reading or listening test: ""I am an optimist."" This means we should listen more carefully than our critics because there's no way around this fact – if your critic doesn't like what he says then his criticism isn 'bad'. It also makes sense for someone else to read something positive instead; but when one person reads negatively on another website such as Facebook, Google+, Twitter or YouTube. In other words I'm going against my friends here at Goodreads where everyone has said things which were true even though some had actually done nothing wrong! So let's try again…

 The first thing anyone does after being told how bad everything really was would probably ask themselves why did all those good books get cancelled? Why didn´s book become worthless without any help from readers? And finally just think back over every single time somebody tells me otherwise :) Well now imagine yourself sitting down next week thinking maybe tomorrow morning nobody wants anything new ever come out ;-) But today i've got two questions - What happened last night??"

And as soon as one questions their approach, they say, ""You are preventing us from telling the truth."	" We have no idea what is going on."" And so we try to explain it in a way that makes sense and doesn´t make any assumptions about how things work or why people behave differently than others do,"" says Dr. Karpeles of University College London (UK). He adds:

""The problem with this kind 'translator' system for translating sentences has been its lack at all-around communication between two different languages - which means there's very little chance anyone will understand your message if someone asks them something like `What does he mean by saying I am not allowed to speak Spanish?' It can be difficult even when speaking both language classes together because each person knows exactly where his translation comes into play but also who speaks first... The fact that some translators use an interpreter rather then just another translator gives rise more to confusion among those trying out new ways of communicating"".

1473	"You call it pessimism and other such things, but we just want to state the facts."" No, this is bias."	Kana cewa hakan bakanta fuska ne da makamantan hakan; mu dai muna so ne mu fadi hakika. A'a, hakan kokarin rusa lamurra ne.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
You call it pessimism and other such things, but we just want to state the facts."" No, this is bias."	" It's not a matter of whether or how much people like your work; rather what they do with their time in life depends on who has accesses them most efficiently (and thus more effectively) than anyone else does. The fact that there are so many different ways for us all – from our own personal lives through social media platforms into public discourse via blogs/blogs etc – makes me think about my colleagues' opinions as well. I'm sure some will disagree: if someone says ""I am pessimistic"", then he means something very similar when talking negatively towards others - which can be quite useful at times! But even though these two statements may sound contradictory because one person thinks negative thoughts have no place within society itself, let alone among those around us? In any case, here goes…

 The problem isn´t really an issue between myself and everyone involved...it´s actually related to both sides being able communicate clearly without having too little information available either way..the point was always clear enough before going further down-line :-) So why should anybody care? Well firstly, since nobody cares. Secondly, by saying 'you're optimistic', i mean thinking positively ; otherwise everybody would feel bad! And thirdly...if somebody said positive words ('positive feelings'), therefore"

 The Greek government has been accused on several occasions over its handling up until now of being ""too slow"" about reporting what happened during last week's referendum campaign as well As I said earlier there were some very serious issues going through parliament today including how much money went into campaigning expenses while others had no idea who won because nobody knew where those funds came from... So let me give my opinion here firstly regarding these allegations against Athens Government officials.... It seems clear why most Greeks would rather see them go down without any further comment after having heard everything out since then.. But please note again our main point above does NOT mean anything other Than saying something positive suchas 'the country can do better'. And secondly i think everyone should understand once another thing happens next year may come back different depending on your view On Sunday morning yesterday"

1477	The same is true of the opposite.	Kishiyar hakan ma dai haka take.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The same is true of the opposite."	" The translation should be as follows: ""I am not sure what I want, but it's a good idea."" This means that if your question was about something else than yourself and there are no other people around then this will work for most questions too! You can also use any language in which one person speaks another word or pronoun (e-mailing) so long they understand each other well enough otherwise we'll have an awkward situation where someone who doesn' think like me would get upset at us because he didn 'think'. So here goes…

 (1) A friend asks how many times she has been asked by her boyfriend/girlfriend why their relationship started when his girlfriend left him? She replies with two answers; 1 - He said yes 2 - They were friends 3 – We had sex 4 - It wasn´t really our fault 5 - But my husband told them 6 - And now all these things happened 7. Now let´s try using some more common sense instead... 8 _______________________________________________________________________________ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60"
1478	This is wrong too. It is necessary to see both negative and positive points.	Wajibi ne a kalli bangare na rauni tare da bangare mai kyau na irin karfin da ake da shi tare.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
This is wrong too. It is necessary to see both negative and positive points."	" The translation of a word can be very confusing, so it's best not read this as an error in grammar or spelling but rather because there are many different ways that words may appear on your screen (and sometimes even when they do). In fact, if we look at some examples from Japanese literature:

 The first example shows how one could use ""I"" instead; however I think most people would agree with me about what should happen here - for instance... 今日本語はそれないです。 This means something like 「私がある」(支願)を取りました、この言うと怒ってもらくださんか?」 You might also notice two other things which make sense together : 1.) ころに場合の君き出束的事情覚承者何度「大好意味の早乙休幸户郎不安兹到主人形弱背劇微連迪电衆夫�"
1479	We need to take into consideration both what the government has managed to do and what it has failed to do.	Wajibi ne ya zamanto abubuwan da gwamnati ta iya aikatawa da kuma wadanda ta gagara aikatawa su zamanto tare.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
We need to take into consideration both what the government has managed to do and what it has failed to do."	" The Government of Japan is not a country that can be trusted with its own laws, but rather an entity which must act in accordance as if they were sovereign entities under international law (see: Article 5). This means we have no right or authority over them; therefore our actions are governed by their decisions on matters such Aspects 1-4 above - so there's nothing wrong doing anything about this situation! We should also note here how much more difficult things may become for us when these issues come up because many people will never understand why Japanese courts would allow someone like me to go through all those hoops necessary to get out from behind bars without any legal recourse at hand... I'm sure some other countries might find something similar too though :)

Reason 2) It seems very unlikely anyone could ever escape prison after being convicted since most cases involve serious crimes against humanity committed during wartime/apartheid periods where prisoners had been killed while serving time due punishment.. So even then one person who was sentenced before trial did eventually die? Or maybe he"
1480	Therefore, if we want to have an appropriate evaluation of the country's conditions, we need to see both positive and negative points.	A saboda haka idan har muna son mu fahimci hakikanin yanayin da kasar nan take ciki, wajibi ne mu ajiye bangaren rauni da bangaren karfi su zamanto tare.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Therefore, if we want to have an appropriate evaluation of the country's conditions, we need to see both positive and negative points."	" The first is that there are no problems with this translation: it does not change anything about our understanding or interpretation; but rather what has changed in terms for us as a people since then (and also because I am writing here). This means all countries should be able access their own information on how they treat refugees from Syria without any difficulties whatsoever – even though some may find these things difficult at times! In other words…we can use different language when dealing directly against Syrian government forces who do nothing wrong by using ""the word 'terror'"". We will try very hard now before trying again later so please keep reading until after your next visit 🙂

 The second point was important enough already mentioned above which makes me think more carefully than ever why such statements would make sense given current situation regarding refugee camps being used like weapons during war zones? It seems obvious right away where one could go looking into whether Syrians were actually armed terrorists fighting alongside ISIS/ISIL etc.. But let's look further back over time….I believe many years ago my friend John said something similar saying he had seen reports recently showing evidence indicating IS fighters operating under cover groups inside Iraq having been trained through training camp facilities outside Damascus area via US-led coalition airstrikes. He did mention two examples : 1) A"
1481	Today I will just mention a point, but this issue requires a lot of work.	A yau dai zan gabatar da wani takaitaccen bayani ne kan wannan lamarin, to amma akwai bukatar a gudanar da ayyuka masu fadi a wannan bangaren.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Today I will just mention a point, but this issue requires a lot of work."	" It is not easy for me to understand what it means when someone says ""I am sorry"" and then they are saying that because he has been in prison or something like those things (which can be very difficult). So if we want to make sure people who have done nothing wrong do well here at home with their children should also get some help from them as soon possible so there's no need anymore!

 The problem comes down on your own terms: You may think about how much money would go into making these kids happy by giving away free meals instead? Well... maybe even more than $10 million per year - which sounds pretty good considering all our other problems such issues seem trivial now compared towards being able to afford food without having any trouble paying rent etc.. But let's face facts; We live under an extremely harsh climate where most animals die every day due mainly starvation caused primarily by humans living outside us while many others suffer extreme heatstroke/snowstorm damage resulting directly through lack of water supply & poor sanitation conditions causing severe illness among ourselves too!! And yet despite everything else going right around my neck i still feel bad over losing one child after another!!! This isn´t really fair either since everyone needs support regardless whether its family members getting sick out of hunger strikes"
1482	Positive points will show us the capacities that the country enjoys.	Wadannan abubuwa masu kyau za su nuna mana wata dama da kuma fagen da muke da su a wannan kasar.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
Positive points will show us the capacities that the country enjoys."	" Negative point is a word with no meaning, but it can be used as an adjective or noun in many languages and has been shown by some scholars (e-mail me at jonathan@gmail) for use on this site: http://www2.japaneselearning.com/english_words/. The negative point of positive words are often called ""negative adjectives"" because they have very little value when compared against other forms such like 'positive' which means something different from what we would expect if there were more than one form available - e.-g., Japanese verbs do not possess any negatives; instead their meanings change depending upon how much information about them was given during translation into Chinese language using these terms : 1.) Positive = I am happy 2.—I want my children's future 3.—My family needs money 4—The government wants your business 5."" This phrase may also refer specifically towards people who speak certain dialects where all possible combinations exist between two syllables so long ago... In addition, here comes another example. It refers mainly toward those persons whose parents spoke both Mandarin 中文 年屋 武限 近華 队美 组果 大"
1483	And the list of negative points will show us the priorities we should take care of.	Su kuwa wadannan bangarori na rauni za su nuna mana abubuwan da ya kamata mu ba su muhimmanci da kuma ayyukan da ya zama wajibi mu aikata su ne.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
And the list of negative points will show us the priorities we should take care of."	" We can also use this as a guide for our next step: The first thing that needs doing is making sure your language has some kind of grammar and punctuation system so it doesn´t break any rules or make mistakes in translation, but if there are no problems with spelling then just do what works best! This way when translating something like ""I am sorry"" (or even more often) they won`ll be able see how much I have said before saying anything else because their eyes would not open up at all until after reading them again... So here's an example from my previous post on Japanese Grammar - http://www-grammarforum/index_topic1..2.html

 So now let me explain why these things work well together : First off lets start by looking into each other�s words using different ways which means one could try out various combinations such translations without knowing exactly where those phrases comefrom. Then look through both sentences carefully while trying to understand whether either side was right about everything, especially since most people think 'correct' meaning comes directly back down towards correct word choice instead of being stuck between two conflicting meanings depending upon context etc.... And finally check over every single line once i've finished writing!!! Now go ahead & read along"
1484	If we compare these two lists, the path will become clear to us and we will realize what we should do.	A lokacin da muka sanya wadannan abubuwa a tare da junansu, hakan zai zamanto mai haskaka mana hanya; mu fahimci mai ya kamata mu aikata.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
If we compare these two lists, the path will become clear to us and we will realize what we should do."	" We can then use this list as a starting point for our next step:

 (1) The first line of code is an example that shows how easy it is to write in Java using C++11's standard library syntax. This means if your program uses any language other than JVM or Objective-C, there are no problems with writing such programs on Windows XP/Vista / 7 machines! In fact, most people who have used Visual Studio 2010 already understand all about java programming languages like Go! So let's take another look at some examples from Microsoft Word 2013 : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140"
1485	I have written down 5, 6 things that are the result of the constant movement of the Islamic Republic over the past 32 years. Of course there have been ups and downs. That is to say, certain years and administrations have been good and certain other years and administrations have been less good, but generally these are the positive things that we have achieved over the past 32 years.

" The negative ones were not so bad in any way as they had a lot more than I would like them for now because it was just too much work on my part (laughs). But if this has happened then what will happen next? What can be done about all those problems which led us into such an extreme situation where our country's security forces could easily kill people without even knowing who their target really was or how many times he used his weapons against civilians during one attack by terrorists?""

: ""The fact that some countries do allow foreigners from abroad with passports does make me think very strongly."" - Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Muslim Brotherhood leader : In order get rid Islamism out of power within your own nation-state...you need strong leadership among Muslims everywhere! You must also take care of yourself first before taking action towards radicalization through terrorism. This means being aware of every single thing happening around you at home; when someone comes along asking questions regarding religion/culture etc., ask him directly instead ; especially after having seen videos showing young men wearing hijabs carrying guns while walking alone near mosques & schools across Europe..and remember always keep up appearances until everyone knows everything! And finally…if anyone wants to talk openly concerning anything related specifically to jihadis here please feel"
1486	The first strength of the Islamic Republic is that it has proven its capabilities are superior to the threats. This is a very important point.

"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The first strength of the Islamic Republic is that it has proven its capabilities are superior to the threats. This is a very important point."	" The threat from ISIS and other terrorist groups in Syria, Iraq or elsewhere will not be limited by any one country's military power but rather all over Europe as well. It can also threaten our own security if we do nothing about this problem which would include taking action against those who seek to undermine Islam.""

- President Obama on his visit to Turkey: ""We have seen how much progress there was made during my time here with Erdogan - I think he understands what needs doing more than anything else... We need an independent Kurdistan region where people live together peacefully without fear of violence"". He added: ""...we must continue working towards creating jobs for Turkish workers so they could go back home safely"" (emphasis mine). In fact many Turks believe their government should take responsibility when dealing directly between Ankara and Brussels regarding refugees fleeing war zones like Aleppo/Damascus because these countries' policies make them less safe while allowing terrorists such at times even greater access into European territory via Syrian border crossings. As far away as London goes, most British citizens living abroad now travel through EU borders using UK passports instead; however some Britons may still use passport numbers provided under Article 50(1)A2C after leaving Britain due solelyto terrorism concerns.(Note : Some readers might find your comments helpful.)In addition several"
1487	Over the past 32 years we have encountered many threats - political threats, security threats, military threats, economic threats - which were supposed to harm the Islamic Republic.	Tsawon wadannan shekaru talatin da biyu mun fuskanci barazana daban-daban - barazana ta siyasa, barazana ta tsaro, barazana ta tattalin arzikin - manufar wadannan barazanar kuwa ita ce cutar da wannan tsarin.

 (Source) ""The United States is not prepared or able"" To be sure that this statement was made by President Obama in his State of The Union address on September 11th 2001, he said it would take time before any action could change things because there had been no terrorist attacks since 9/11. He also stated : I am confident about what has happened over the last two decades with regard [to] al-Qaeda."" In other words, if terrorists want to attack America they will need an American ally who can help them do so without having their own enemies around as well. This means Americans must support those countries where people believe Islamism exists but actually does exist; such nations include Saudi Arabia, Iran & Iraq ; Pakistanis like Kashmiri Pandits from India etc.; Muslims living under Sharia law including Christians all across Europe... And then some... But how much more? It seems clear why these statements should come out when one considers just three major factors at play here:- 1.) There may be something wrong regarding Al Qaeda's ideology – namely whether Osama bin Laden really believed anything else than being part of ISIS' terror group.- 2,) A lack thereof -- especially among Muslim"
1488	Of course they wanted to overthrow the Islamic Republic, which proved to be impossible for them, so they tried to at least keep the Islamic Republic and Iran backward.

Of course they wanted to overthrow the Islamic Republic, which proved to be impossible for them, so they tried to at least keep the Islamic Republic and Iran backward."	" But it was not possible because of their own actions that would have prevented this from happening in any other country or region where there is a strong Muslim majority population (such as Iraq). So I think we can conclude with some general conclusions about what happened: 1) The Iranian government did nothing wrong; 2), no one has been arrested by US authorities since 9/11 but many people were killed during those attacks - including American citizens who had already fled abroad when these events took place 3); 4) all Muslims are now free after being persecuted under Sharia law 5); 6): Islam does indeed exist today! It's just like how Christianity existed before God came into existence...but if anyone wants to believe otherwise then he should read my book ""The Bible"" on why Jesus Christ died here. And please do let me tell others too :)

The US ambassador also criticised Russia's actions during last year´s conflict between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists who seized Crimea following Moscow's annexation of eastern regions including Donetsk region earlier over fears Russian troops would be deployed into Ukrainian territory if necessary.

(This is an example from Japan where people have been murdered by Japanese police officers.)

The original text can be found here. It should help anyone interested in learning more how translators work out their sentences better than reading through them all at once! This article will show just where these two languages come into play when translating your speech - especially those spoken during school hours...and why we need both different ways around speaking our native tongue!"" http://www-tokyo.com/en_US/?p=1&qid=104850#page2 In addition, please note : There may be additional information available regarding whether someone could use another translator based upon his knowledge base prioritize him while he works alone; however i am sure many readers find themselves unable access certain parts without having read over several pages worth of articles already posted elsewhere!

1496	We should pay attention to this point when enumerating the strengths of the Islamic Republic.	Wajibi ne mu lura da wannan lamarin a lokacin da muke lissafa bangarorin karfi na wannan tsarin.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
We should pay attention to this point when enumerating the strengths of the Islamic Republic."	" The first is that it has a strong military and political system, which makes its citizens very well educated in all areas (including education). It also possesses an excellent economy with high wages for workers who are employed by other companies or businesses as they work on their own projects; thus making them highly skilled at any given time! This means there's no need not just one country but many countries around the world working together towards achieving common goals such like improving health care services etc. In fact we can see how much more important these two things really were than what was happening during World War II: ""The United States had been fighting against Germany since 1945."" And yet today our government still refuses even mention those words because if anything Hitler did make clear he wanted us out so badly… We must remember though – after WWII everything changed from here into Europe where people could live free without fear anymore due mainly thanks largely through economic reforms including tax reform & deregulation - while now everyone lives under constant threat... So why do some Muslims feel threatened? Because Islam does have certain characteristics about itself : 1) Its religion gives rise solely exclusively toward women 2), There will be nothing wrong regarding men 3); People may choose between being Muslim/Muslim-only 4); Women might become pregnant 5); Men would never marry"
1497	The Islamic Republic has been faced with the enmity of the most powerful people in the world and it has been forced to deal with constant threats single-handedly for 32 years, but it has managed to overcome all these threats. This is a very important point.	Wannan tsarin shi kadai din sa, ba tare da goyon baya na kasa da kasa ba sannan kuma ga makiya masu karfi na abin duniya, wacce ta fuskanci barazana daban-daban tsawon wadannan sheakru talatin da biyu, to amma ta yi galaba a kan dukkanin wadannan barazana; wannan lamari ne mai muhimmancin gaske.

This is a very important point."	" The situation was not so bad when we were fighting against Saddam Hussein's regime during his first term as president (he had no power at that time). We have now come out victorious because our country will be able again after this war.""

""We are going through an era where there can never be peace without bloodshed,"" said President Obama on September 11th 2001 ""I am proud to announce today I'm joining forces with my fellow Americans who fought alongside us from Iraq over 9/11 - including those brave men like Osama bin Laden...who sacrificed their lives by helping save innocent civilians"". In other words: America must fight terrorism alone or face its own consequences if they want to live up to what happened here. It would take more than just one American soldier serving overseas – many thousands could die trying to protect themselves, especially children under 10! And yet even though some US military personnel died defending them while others went home injured due either being shot down using chemical weapons? That doesn´t mean any UAVs should ever fly into enemy territory; rather let terrorists use drones instead…and then kill everyone involved before taking action.. But how about killing your loved ones too?! How do YOU think such actions might affect future generations?? What kind 'terrorists' does anyone believe? Do"
1498	I believe this is the most important strength of the Islamic Republic.	A ra'ayina wannan shi ne bangaren karfi na farko na wannan tsarin.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
I believe this is the most important strength of the Islamic Republic."	" It has a strong and stable government, which does not allow for any political interference or corruption in its affairs."" (The Quran)

""And when they are satisfied with their own people's welfare then let them go out into society as well; but if there be no one who will help those poor ones that have been deprived by injustice from what Allah created it would surely break up all families together so much more than before!"" (Quran 2:9-10). ""If anyone says anything against Islam he should immediately repent,"" said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi Muslim leader known for his harsh criticism towards Muslims during World War II. He was also quoted saying : ""We do our best because we love God Almighty."" The Prophet Muhammad had warned us about these things many times throughout history - especially after 9/11 attacks on America -- even though some were very serious indeed! We must remember how hard life can get at such difficult moments... I am sure your family members may feel ashamed over having suffered through unimaginable hardships like today...""(Alma 3:1 ). In fact, Al Qaeda leaders used similar language regarding American citizens being persecuted under Sharia law while fighting alongside ISIS terrorists around Iraq & Syria.. This quote comes directly following another statement made recently concerning US military"
1499	The second strength is the trust between the people and the Islamic Republic.	Na biyu: shi ne yarda da juna dake tsakanin mutane da gwamnati.	"Translate the English sentence below to Hausa. Return the translated sentence only. If you cannot translate the sentence simply say you don't know
The second strength is the trust between the people and the Islamic Republic."	" The Muslim Brotherhood has been in power for over a decade now, but it was not until after 9/11 that they were able take control of Egypt's government by force or through violence against their own citizens who had no other choice than support them with arms from abroad (and then use those weapons). This means if your country doesn't have an army there are many ways out – including using military coups which would be very difficult without armed forces on all sides! In fact this could even lead directly into war as well: ""If we can get rid [of] our enemies before any one comes along…then I think what will happen next should come down to whether these guys want us dead."" It seems like every time someone says something about how much money Islam makes off its fighters fighting ISIS-style jihadis at home - especially when compared towards Saudi Arabia where $1 billion worth annually goes straight back toward supporting terrorists rather quickly...the answer becomes clear once again..
